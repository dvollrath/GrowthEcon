## Growth Economics Blog Source
Raw files for the www.growthecon.com website. This is built using Jekyll. Because I use several plugins (like jekyll-scholar), I build this site locally in this repository, and then rsync it to the dvollrath.github.io repository, which is what Github uses to host the actual www.growthecon.com website. 

The Jekyll theme is Airspace - see below for links to their site if you want to use the them.
