<p>I've posted up slides for use with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Economic-Growth-Third-Edition/dp/039391917X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358275303&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Jones+Vollrath"><em>Introduction to Economic Growth</em></a> on the <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/class-material/" title="Class Material">Class Materials</a> page.</p>
<p>I am a bit of a slide minimalist, so they are not done with Beamer, but they were created using TEX. They contain all the important equations and figures from the book, but there is not a lot of verbiage. I tend to leave that off the slides to force myself to talk through things more slowly. </p>
<p>Both the PDFs and the original TEX are posted (along with the necessary figure files). So you can use them as-is or feel free to edit them as necessary. Happy to hear back comments on them if you do use them in an undergrad class. </p>
