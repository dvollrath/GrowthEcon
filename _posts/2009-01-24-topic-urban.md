title: Is there something special about cities for economic growth?
published: true

As economies grow richer, they urbanize. Which way does the causality run? There are a lot of reasons to suspect that urban areas are drivers of economic growth, but what is it about urban areas that makes them such centers of innovation? Are there differences in urban areas that developed earlier or later in history, or that grew because of natural resource booms versus manufacturing expansions?
