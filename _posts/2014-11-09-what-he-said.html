<p>When I grow up, I want to be Lant Pritchett. He gives an <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/blog/your-impact-evaluation-asking-questions-matter-four-part-smell-test">excellent summary</a> of issues that I've <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/defining-development-economics/" title="Defining Development Economics">tried to get my head around before</a>.</p>
<p>Lant's big question is "Are interventions being evaluated important for development?". I think the answer is no. The interventions - bed nets, micro-credit, deworming - are crucially important for poverty alleviation. But that does necessarily have anything to do with economic development. </p>
