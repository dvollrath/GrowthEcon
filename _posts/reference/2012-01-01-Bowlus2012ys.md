Abstract: Separate identification of the price and quantity of human capital has important implications for understanding key issues in econom- ics. Price and quantity series are derived for four education levels. The price series are highly correlated and they exhibit a strong secu- lar trend. Three resulting implications are explored: the rising col- lege premium is found to be driven more by relative quantity than relative price changes, life-cycle wage profiles are readily interpre- table as reflecting optimal human capital investment paths using the estimated price series, and adjusting the labor input for quality increases dramatically reduces the contribution of MFP to growth.
