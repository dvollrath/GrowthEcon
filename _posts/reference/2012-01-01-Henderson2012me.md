Abstract: We develop a statistical framework to use satellite data on night lights to augment official income growth measures. For countries with poor national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a composite with roughly equal weights on conventionally mea- sured growth and growth predicted from lights. Our estimates dif- fer from official data by up to three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical analyses of growth need no longer use coun- tries as the unit of analysis; we can measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We show, for example, that coastal areas in sub-Saharan Africa are growing slower than the hinterland.
