Abstract: The importance of history, culture, and biogeography in shaping current institutions and the long-run process of economic development is the subject of an important and growing field of research, attracting prominent scholars from different backgrounds. This special issue brings together contributions that investigate both theoretically and empirically the potential mechanisms that mediate the link between institutional and economic development.
