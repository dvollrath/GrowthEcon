Abstract: I modify the uniform-price auction rules in allowing the seller to ration bidders. This allows me to provide a strategic foundation for underpricing when the seller has an interest in ownership dispersion. Moreover, many of the so-called \&quot;collusive-seeming\&quot; equilibria disappear.
