Abstract: We investigate the role of deeply-rooted pre-colonial ethnic institutions in shaping com-
parative regional development within African countries. We combine information on the
spatial distribution of ethnicities before colonization with regional variation in contempo-
rary economic performance, as proxied by satellite images of light density at night. We
document a strong association between pre-colonial ethnic political centralization and re-
gional development. This pattern is not driven by differences in local geographic features
or by other observable ethnic-specific cultural and economic variables. The strong positive
association between pre-colonial political complexity and contemporary development ob-
tains also within pairs of adjacent ethnic homelands with different legacies of pre-colonial
political institutions.
