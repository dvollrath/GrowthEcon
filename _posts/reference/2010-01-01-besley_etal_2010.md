Abstract: This paper develops a simple model to analyze how a lack of politi- cal competition may lead to policies that hinder economic growth. We test the predictions of the model on panel data for the US states. In these data, we {\"O}nd robust evidence that lack of political competition in a state is associated with anti-growth policies: higher taxes, lower capital spending and a reduced likelihood of using right-to-work laws. We also document a strong link between low political competition and low income growth.
