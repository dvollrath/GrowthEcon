Abstract: The level of ethnic diversity is believed to have significant consequences for economic and political development within countries. In this article, we provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the determinants of ethnic diversity in the world. We introduce a model of cultural and ge- netic drift where new ethnic groups endogenously emerge among periph- eral populations as a response to an insufficient supply of public goods. In line with our model, we find that the duration of human settlements has a strong positive association with ethnic diversity. Ethnic diversity decreases with the length of modern state experience and with distance from the equator. Both \&quot;primordial\&quot; and \&quot;constructivist\&quot; hypotheses of ethnic fractionalization thus receive some support by our analysis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
