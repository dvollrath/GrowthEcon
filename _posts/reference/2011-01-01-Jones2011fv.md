Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for human capital measurement. The generalized framework can (i) substantially amplify the role of human capital in accounting for cross-country income di{\S}erences and (ii) reconcile the existing con{\'a}ict between regression and accounting evidence in assessing the wealth and poverty of nations. One natural interpretation emphasizes di{\S}erences across economies in the acquisition of advanced knowledge by skilled workers.
