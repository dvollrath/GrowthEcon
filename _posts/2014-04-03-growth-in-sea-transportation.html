<p>I saw <a href="http://qz.com/193847/two-maps-that-show-the-evolution-of-global-shipping/">these</a> incredibly cool images of shipping routes over time (original source is assistant professor <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/history/faculty/benjamin-macdonald-schmidt/">Ben Schmidt</a> from Northeastern). They map actual voyages taken, ship by ship, so you can see not just the routes but the density of usage.</p>
<p>First, one showing routes from mid-19th century</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/shipping-routes-1860.png" alt="1860 shipping" /></p>
<p>Second, here is the same map done with data from 1980-1997. </p>

<p>Very nice, quick summaries of the expansion in trade over a century. Shows the expansion of Asia, in particular, in this time period. </p>
