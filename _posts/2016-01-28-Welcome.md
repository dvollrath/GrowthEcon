This is both a welcome message to my new site - [growthecon.com](http://growthecon.com) - as well as a test that everything is working out alright. 

The Growth Economics Blog is now located here, but the old [Wordpress site](https://growthecon.wordpress.com) will linger on for a while. I know people have links set up to old posts that they may use in classes. I'll provide some warning of when those links will die. And they may never die, because I will probably forget to ever close down the old Wordpress site. 

For now, if you are still along for the ride, I appreciate it. In terms of following the new site:

1. **Email**. I've set up a new mailing service for all the existing subscribers. You should have to do nothing. If you would like to subscribe via email, there is a link at the bottom of the home page to do that.
2. **RSS**. Click [here](http://growthecon.com/feed.xml) for the new feed, or copy and paste the link into your favorite reader.
3. **Twitter**. New posts will continue to get pushed to Twitter, so follow me at [@DietzVollrath](https://twitter.com/DietzVollrath).

Comments are enabled here, and the old comments have all been imported. You may have to create a new login for the new commenting service. I apologize for that, but I didn't have any way around it. 

Thanks for reading!
