title: When and why did economies achieve sustained growth?
published: true
category: topic
---

For most of history economies did not see growth in output per capita - it fluctuated, but there was no distinct trend. That changed around .... well, it depends on what country we're talking about and who you ask ... but let's say somewhere between 1600 and today. This topic is mainly about stories for the takeoff to sustained growth in England and the rest of the western economies, including debates on the timing and on the reasons: institutions, technology, culture, geography, dumb luck.
