# Summary
The overall purpose of this workshop is to accelerate your research and get you to write papers, so that you can be successful on the job market. Doing this requires you to learn a set of skills that are part of being a professional economist. By the end of this workshop in May, you should have a completed 3rd year paper, a presentation of that paper, a reading committee of three advisors, an organized bibliography, a set of about 20 paper summaries in your field, a library of code and data for your project, a website, a syllabus for an undergraduate class, and an up to date CV.

# Mechanics
We will meet mainly in the graduate computer lab, Fridays from 10:30-noon. We are meeting in the lab as many of the assignments are meant to be worked on in class, and require a computer. If you have a laptop, feel free to use that instead. On days where a computer will not be necessary, we'll meet in one of the classrooms downstairs in McElhinney. This workshop is required by the department, and hence your attendance is required. Please contact me if you have an issue that requires you to miss a class. 

All the readings mentioned in assignments are available on my website (see the link under "Classes" for "Ec8361").
