Some of this just has to do with your choice of "start date" in your analysis. For the biogeography crowd, the start date is, at the latest, the onset of organized agriculture in roughly 10,000 BCE. 

If you advance your start date to 1000 CE, or 1500 CE, or 1825 CE, then your going to find more of a place for institutions or culture, because those things will have had almost 10,000 years to evolve, adapt, and diverge across regions. 

An implicit assumption that is floating around in the biogeography literature is that the groups of people being studied in 10,000 BCE were not sophisticated enough to appreciate or conciously mold their institutions and culture to the available biogeography. That may be the weak point in this line of research. Here's one way to think about the problem. If the groups of people in 10,000 BCE were, because of some institutional or cultural characteristic, choosing to *move* into a specific biogeographic niche, then you cannot say the biogeography determined the institutions or culture. So the biogeography lit is presuming that the groups being studied either were *always* located in that area, or that if they arrive in that area at some earlier point in history (which had to be true, given that humans migrated out from East Africa), that arrival was essentially random. That could be a big bite to swallow.
