Difference between IR and sustained growth

Broadberry et al 
Humphries Weisdorf - annual wages

1650, not 1800 or 1850 - much more in line with the Dutch/English age of exploration than with machines per se. IR changed society, perhaps, by more, but trade generated the jump to sustained growth? Why did fertility not keep up in 1650?
