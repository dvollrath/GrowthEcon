Let's say I have preferences over beer and yoga classes. My reaction to productivity growth depends on my exact preferences over these two things. 

Think of a situation where my preferences are Leontief over two goods, beer and yoga classes. I like to drink 1 beer for every hour I spend in yoga class, no matter what. 

Why would there still be innovation? Why would people bother to come up with improvements in either beer or yoga class production if there was no return to it? 

Now lets say that people have close to Leontief preferences between goods and services in general. *Within* the goods sector it still makes sense to do innovation. I could invent a new beer that is better than old beer, for example, and I could replace the old beer maker in the market. Profits! But even though I could do this, it wouldn't cause anyone to substitute their service expenditures for goods expenditures, because of the Leontief preferences. *Within* services, a similar logic holds up. I might innovate to replace existing yoga teachers with my own new class, but this isn't going to generate any substitution away from goods towards services.

In this setting, the explanation for a general slowdown in productivity is the fact that we are approaching Leontief preferences. We've substituted away from goods about as much as possible, so there is little scope anymore for growth coming through that channel. 

What happens if *all* the services get more productive, though? In that case, there is no change in their relative prices with respect to each other. 

1. Alice spends 1 hour giving a concert for Bob and Charlie
2. Bob spends 1 hour giving a yoga class for Alice and Charlie
3. Charlie spends 1 hour giving a lecture on yak farming to Alice and Bob

What if they *all* get more productive? Alice's music gets better, Bob's discovers some new poses, and Charlie includes some color photos to really make yak farming come alive. 

This would show up as GDP growth only if Alice, Bob, and Charlie's services have become better than
