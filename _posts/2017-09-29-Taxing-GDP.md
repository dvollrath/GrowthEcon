The misunderstanding here is that we don't directly tax GDP, we tax financial transactions that may or may not be involved in GDP. 

The theory of how lower taxes would boost the level of GDP (and hence translate into temporarily higher growth in GDP) is through the suppy of inputs like labor, capital, and ideas. Providing these labor costs you leisure time, providing capital costs you consumption goods, and providing ideas costs you some combination of those two things, depending on how you think innovation works. Regardless, providing inputs is costly. But, providing inputs generates a flow of income in response: wages, dividends or interest, or profits. The theory is that if you lower tax rates, you increase the flow of income from providing labor, capital, and ideas, and on the margin we'd expect that this would lead people to provide more of all three inputs. If there are more of all three inputs, then GDP will be higher. 

The hole in the theory is that "income taxes" or "corporate income taxes" are levied on 




If you lower tax rates on 1 and 2, you should theoretically get a bigger supply of 


Here's an example to help get your head around what I mean. Right now, gifts of money from one person to another are untaxed if they are below $14,000, total, in a year. I can write a stranger a check for $14,000 (if I had it) and we would not have to tell the IRS about it. But if I wrote them a check for $15,000, we'd have to report that to the IRS. The $1,000 of that gift over the exclusion would be subject to taxation. It looks like the rate on that is 18% right now. The stranger would owe $180 in gift tax. The gift is really only worth $14,820. 

So, let's lower the tax rate. To keep things simple, let's do this by lowering the rate from 18% to 10%, and leave the exclusion set at $14,000. With this new lower tax rate, the tax on my $15,000 gift to the stranger is only $100, and the net gift has gone up to $14,900. Presumably that makes me a little happier, as my gift is now more valuable. By standard economic logic, with a lower tax rate, this is going to generate more gift transactions. Either I'll raise my gifts to random strangers, maybe to $16,000, or I'll start writing checks to more random strangers. 

What effect does this have on GDP? None. Pure gifts of money have no effect, because they do not involve a good or service being exchanged, and GDP is *only* the value of goods and services exchanged. Lowering the gift tax generates a bigger supply of gifts, but as these gifts are a pure financial transaction, the don't do anything to raise GDP.

Your objection at this point will be that it *could* raise GDP *if* the gift was used to buy goods and services. Maybe, but then you have to ask what I was going to do with the gift if I didn't give it to the stranger. I said that in response to the lower gift tax rate, I raised my gift to $16,000, so the increase in gift activity was $1,000. We have to compare what the stranger does with that $1,000 to what I would have done with it without the tax cut. If the stranger goes out and buys $1,000 of beer with it, but I would have bought $1,000 of beer with it myself if the tax rate were higher, then there is no change to GDP. If I had that $1,000 buried under a rock, but the stranger uses it to buy $1,000 in beer, then there might be a net increase in GDP. But maybe not, because if you think prices are really flexible then the extra $1,000 spent on beer will just push up the price of beer relative to the price of other goods, and the total amount of goods and services produced will not change. 

In the end, the only way to truly ensure that lowering this gift tax will raise GDP is if somehow it induces an increase in the supply of labor, capital goods, or innovation. And since it is a pure gift, not given in payment for the provision of labor, capital, or innovation, by standard economic theory it will have exactly *zero* effect on the amount of labor, capital, and innovation the stranger supplies. 

But, wait. Maybe lowering the gift tax will result in an increase in *my* supply of labor, capital, or innovation. If I get such joy out of writing checks to strangers, then by making that more appealing to me with a lower tax rate, I'll have an incentive to raise my own income so I can write more checks. I



If you were serious about raising GDP, then you'd lower taxes on the provision of inputs, and raise taxes on transactions that do not directly play into GDP, like inheritances or the exchange of stocks and bonds.
