## Spatial resources for class
You need RStudio (and R) installed. 

- [Tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8ani76lp0yeiae5/AACTX9DfRgBXDdXYRNpkMRbRa?dl=0) is the dropbox link to a folder (and sub-folders) of materials that we'll use in working with GIS data. 
- [GADM](https://gadm.org/download_world.html) is the source for boundaries of political units. You want to download the whole world, and have separate shape-files for each of the different levels.
- [DMSP](https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html) is the source for night lights. Note that as of late January, this site is down due to the government shutdown. See the tutorial link.
