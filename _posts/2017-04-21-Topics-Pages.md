Less of a post, and more of an announcement. I just created some new pages here at Growthecon.com that collect resources and materials related to specific topics regarding growth. See the [Topics](https://growthecon.com/topics/) link in the header of the webpage. 

This was an exercise in intellectual housecleaning, and a way to organize some materials for possible use in classes in the future. Each topic has links to my own posts on the subject, links to other web articles or resources, and some selected academic citations. The topics are thus more accessible, but less comprehensive, then the pages of [references](https://growthecon.com/references/) that are also posted on this site.

Right now, the topics include

1. [Are we rich?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Are-We-Rich/)
2. [Can you reform your way to higher growth?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Converge-Reform/)
3. [Does growth depend on competition?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Comp-Assumptions/)
4. [Does economic growth mean economic development?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Dev-Growth/)
5. [Productivity slowdown](http://localhost:4000/blog/Productivity-Slowdown/)
6. [Is manufacturing special?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Manuf-Special/)
7. [Robots and jobs](http://localhost:4000/blog/Robots-Jobs/)
8. [Deep determinants of development](http://localhost:4000/blog/Inst-Geography/)
9. [Does economic growth harm the environment?](http://localhost:4000/blog/Growth-Nature/)
