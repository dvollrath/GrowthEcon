<p>Chris Blattman has put up a very <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2014/11/26/believe-institutions-growth-literature/">nice response</a> to my institutions posts, including a number of good points on what the institutions literature in economics tends to overlook. You should go read that right now.</p>
<p>He's also added about 10 things to my "to be read" list. So thanks, Chris, for the additional crushing burden of guilt. </p>
