<p>First, great reading lists from <a href="http://antonhowes.tumblr.com/">Anton Howes</a> and <a href="http://pseudoerasmus.com/">Pseudoerasmus</a> on economic history, often from a very broad perspective. These are all books that I (and you, if you're reading this) should have read already, but I promise I'll be good next year and get to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/ref=cm_wl_edit_brc?ie=UTF8&amp;id=3TW7GIHFY1M5S&amp;type=wishlist">Anton's Amazon wishlist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37472348-pseudoerasmus-econ-history-only?sort=author">Pseudoerasmus' Goodreads list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I put up a new section of <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/maps/" title="Maps">maps</a> that I use when I teach economic growth. Will attempt to get around to putting together slides and post those some day too.</p>
