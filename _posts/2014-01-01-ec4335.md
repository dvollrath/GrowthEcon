This class covers topics related to the long-run growth rate of living standards. This includes how we measure real living standards, the Solow model of capital accumulation, models of technological change and innovation, the role of trade in fostering growth, the effect of population growth on economic growth, the influence of growth on natural resources, and questions about why some countries are rich while others remain poor. 

The book for the class is [Introduction to Economic Growth]({{ site.baseurl }}/book/), by Jones and Vollrath. You need the 3rd edition, without exception. You can purchase an online version or a PDF version for much cheaper than the physical book [here](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-formats.aspx?ID=4294969960).
