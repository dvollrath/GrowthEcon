Cicero occupies a position closer to Newt Gingrinch than Abraham Lincoln on the scale of statesmen. Like Gingrich, he acquired a perch from which to speak, and he was good at it. Hence the principals of this era stayed in contact with him as a useful tool, the same way that politicians might book a segment with Gingrinch on Fox News. 

He was the equivalent of a devoted Yankees fan from Chicago: a frontrunner desparate for approval from the in crowd. He was a kiss-ass. He ordered the execution of the conspirators in the Catiline conspiracy for the same reasons fraternity pledges do beer bongs. 

He did not adhere to principles, but rather to witticisms. He did not struggle to find clever ways to express his underlying principles, rather he adopted principles because there were clever ways to express them. 

He conspired to be absent from any major decision taken by the principal actors in this era. Tusculum, Mutina, Triumvirate declaration.
