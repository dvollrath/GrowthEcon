        <title>Are some places &quot;More Malthusian&quot; than other?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Constraints/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Constraints/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a new working paper out (&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2017-06-28-Constraint.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/hou/wpaper/2017-192-55.html&quot;&gt;repec&lt;/a&gt;), co-authored with Ryan Johnson, on Malthusian constraints. There is some material that we’re cutting from the paper, because it is already getting too long, but I kind of like the graphs and the results, so I figured I would write them up here. Fair warning: there will be some math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Malthus/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote not too long ago on what “Malthusian” means, I said that a key feature of a Malthusian economy was that living standards are &lt;em&gt;inversely&lt;/em&gt; related to population size. Typically, we’d think of this as being due to fixed (or very expensive to acquire) amounts of agricultural land. What Ryan and I are trying to figure out is exactly how sensitive living standards are to population size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is related directly to the elasticity of agricultural output with respect to land. That is, by what percent does ag output go up if I increase the supply of land by 10%? Now, I just said you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; change the supply of land, but that doesn’t mean we cannot think about a hypothetical where you could. So what Ryan and I do in the paper is try to estimate that elasticity very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the logic, and how we get there, let me lay out a little math. Agricultural production is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Y = A X^{\beta} L^{1-\beta}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where A is productivity, X is the amount of land, and L is the number of people. The value of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is the elasticity I was talking about. If you divide both sides of this equation by L, you get an expression for output per worker (i.e. living standards) of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Y/L = A (X/L)^{\beta}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which says that living standards depend inversely on population size, L. That’s the Malthusian assumption. What this expression also says is that the elasticity of &lt;em&gt;living standards&lt;/em&gt; with respect to L is equal to &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this fairly intuitive. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; tells us how important land is for producing food, relative to labor. If &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is close to one, then land is the only thing that matters. It’s as if the land produces a fixed amount of food every year, regardless of how much work we put in. In that case, adding extra people reduces living standards by a lot, because there is no extra food to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is close to zero, then land doesn’t matter much at all. Most of what drives food production is the effort of the workers. In that case, if we add population, living standards only fall by a little, because each new person is able to produce a lot of extra food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, we refer to an economy where &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is large as having “tight Malthusian constraints” because living standards are very sensitive to the number of people. In constrast, an economy with a a low &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; has “loose Malthusian constraints” because the number of people doesn’t affect living standards by much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To figure out the size of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;, we do the following. Think of a bunch of economies with a similar living standard, so Y/L is a constant, and call that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\overline{y}\inline&quot;/&gt;. Then rearrange the equation for living standards above to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;L/X = \frac{A^{1/\beta}}{\overline{y}^{1/\beta}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This says that population density will be high where productivity, A, is high, holding constant living standards. But notice that the strength of this relationship depends on the size of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. In areas with “tight” Malthusian constraints, and high &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; values, the sensitivity of population density to productivity should be &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt;. Because land matters a lot to production, the population gets spread evenly over all the land available, even if that land has fundamentally different productivity levels. If everyone tried to crowd into the highest productivity place, they’d drive down living standards by a lot. We should see similar population density across places with different inherent agricultural productivity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In places with “loose” Malthusian constraints, the opposite logic holds. The sensitivity of population density to productivity will be &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone can crowd into the small area of land with the best natural fertility, and living standards remain high, because living standards aren’t very sensitive to the size of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a slightly more complicated setup, this is the logic that Ryan and I use to estimate the size of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. We look at how the density of rural population is related to measures of inherent land productivity, and we do that for districts within states (i.e. compare all the counties in Texas to one another), using data from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can also do this a little more loosely using historical data on the density of population by country, and this analysis isn’t going to fit in the paper. What we do is take the data from the paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v101y2011i5p2003-41.html&quot;&gt;Quamrul Ashraf and Oded Galor&lt;/a&gt; that I mentioned in the Malthusian post, which establishes that population density in 1500CE is positively related to productivity across countries, just as the last equation predicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those guys, though, threw all the countries in the world together to do their analysis, and what Ryan and I did was look at the relationship of density and productivity in their data for specific regions, like Europe, Africa, etc.. Here’s the graph showing what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_ag_regions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Density and Productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “residual agricultural productivity” term on the x-axis is variation in agricultural productivity after we controlled for all the other things that Ashraf and Galor control for (latitude, etc..). Agricultural productivity is an amalgam of things related to how much of a country is suitable for cultivation. It’s based on climate characteristics and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that Europe looks a lot different than the other three regions plotted: Asia (really South and Southeast Asia), Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mideast/North Africa. For Europe, there is no distinct relationship between density and productivity. This, using the logic I laid out above, says that the land constraint in Europe was very “tight”, with a high &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. If you take the math seriously, it says that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is approaching infinity, as the slope of the line should indicate a value of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. That is probably wrong, and is one of the reasons we like our district-level data for this job instead. Regardless, compared to the other regions, Europe looks like a place where living standards were very sensitive to population size. The other regions show a higher slope, indicating that more productive places were a lot more densely populated, and that is consistent with “loose” Malthusian constraints. Their living standards were apparently less sensitive to population size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in the average level of density (i.e. all of Europe’s dots are shifted up compared to the other regions) is capturing other unobserved “stuff” about Europe that just made it have high population density. For our purposes this shift isn’t as interesting as the relationship within each region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, great, Malthusian constraints were tighter in Europe than in other regions historically. So what? To see the importance, let’s go back to the relationship of living standards, Y/L, with productivity and land, and realize that there is more to life than food. That is, Y/L is my little model here is &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; output per person &lt;em&gt;in agriculture&lt;/em&gt;. For lots of historic economies, nearly everyone is in agriculture, and food is a massive share of what they consume, so just talking about “output” and “population” is fine. But to see the influence of constraints on development, we can be a little more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be specific that we’re talking about agricultural output per agricultural person, so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Y_A/L_A = A (X/L_A)^{\beta}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, let N be the total population, which includes both agricultural workers, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_A\inline&quot;/&gt;, and non-ag workers (e.g. urban dwellers, etc..). I’m going to multiply and divide the left-hand side by N, and do some re-arranging of this equation. You can check my work, but I’m pretty sure this holds up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{Y_A}{N}\left(\frac{N}{L_A}\right)^{1-\beta}\left(\frac{N}{X}\right)^{\beta} = A.&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right is just productivity. The left side tells me what I can do with that productivity. If productivity goes &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, for whatever reason (i.e. the Glorious Revolution! The Columbian exchange! The Pope bans consanguinous marriages! Horse collars are invented! Someone planted turnips!) I can translate that into any or all of three things: increased food per person, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_A/N\inline&quot;/&gt;, increased population per agricultural worker, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N/L_A\inline&quot;/&gt;, or increased population density, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N/X\inline&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; features here in the trade-off between increasing population per ag worker or population density. In places with “tight” constraints, where &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is large, a small increase in population density would “eat up” the productivity gain very quickly. At the same time, because &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is small, it takes a big increase in the population to ag worker ratio (i.e. urbanization) to “eat up” the productivity gain. A tight Malthusian constraint makes urbanization relatively cheap compared to increasing density. The opposite logic says that a loose Malthusian constraint makes density relatively cheap compared to urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence places with tight contraints, like Europe, may have had a built-in advantage in &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt;, even if they didn’t have an advantage in &lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt;, A. It could be &lt;em&gt;part of&lt;/em&gt; the explanation for why Europe took off relative to the rest of the world, given that other areas had high productivity levels and productivity growth at least during some periods of their history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot to load onto one figure and a couple of equations. Ryan and I think we do a good job in the paper of establishing that the differences in &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; across regions of the world are robust, and those differences appear related to underlying geographic characteristics (i.e. Malthusian constraints are tighter where winters are colder). The implications of those differences are harder to get at, of course, but we think there’s a plausible story floating around in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of this isn’t confined to historical development, either. For current developing countries, the tightness of the Malthusian constraint dictates the relative cost of urbanization versus density. We find very loose land constraints in tropical areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America, perhaps offering some clue as to why they fell behind areas like East Asia, despite having similar starting conditions in the mid 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Return of Peasant Mentality?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Peasant/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Peasant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without intending to, I ended up taking a blog hiatus (blacation?) for about a month. But in that month I built up a whole reserve of speculative energy that I now need to disgorge all at once. So strap in, because this one gets hairy towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thing that has interested me since grad school is the clear gap in labor productivity between urban and rural areas, or between non-agricultural workers and agricultural workers. There are two big questions that come up given that fact. Why do those gaps exist? What effect do those gaps have, if any, on development? I’ve taken a couple of swipes at the second question &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/JDE_Final.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/dvhc2014.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those papers, I did have to think about the first question, why the gaps exist at all. It seems like if there were big labor productivity gaps, then there should be big wage gaps, and if there were big wage gaps, then people would have moved from the low-wage rural areas to high-wage urban areas already. One possibility is that those gaps exist because of differences in human capital of workers between the two sectors. If rural workers have less human capital, then their &lt;em&gt;labor&lt;/em&gt; productivity (output per hour, say) will be lower than urban workers, even if the &lt;em&gt;human capital&lt;/em&gt; productivity (output per unit of HC) is identical in rural and urban areas. In this case, the labor productivity gap may not represent any distortion or friction, as the return to a unit of human capital is identical across sectors, and therefore would not imply any kind of macro-level inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And over the years, I’d say that more and more evidence accumulates that this is the case. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v128y2013i4p1727-1785.html&quot;&gt;Alwyn Young&lt;/a&gt; has a recent paper showing that there is a ton of movement back and forth between rural and urban areas in developing countries, and so it seems unlikely that some kind of friction, or moving cost, is keeping people from responding to any gaps in wages that might exist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v104y2014i5p165-70.html&quot;&gt;Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh&lt;/a&gt; find that gaps in human capital productivity are smaller than the gaps in labor productivity, although there is still a gap. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/red/sed014/364.html&quot;&gt;Schoellman and Herrendorf&lt;/a&gt; look at raw wage gaps - which should be related to labor productivity - across sectors in a number of countries, and find that they are explained almost entirely by differences in human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one issue with these studies is that they (and me in my earlier papers) are comparing two different groups of people: rural workers and urban workers. There may be unobservable differences in their human capital that we cannot account for using things like education or experience, and so we don’t really know if our measures of human capital productivity are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to a recent working paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/23253.html&quot;&gt;Hamory-Hicks, Kleemans, Li, and Miguel&lt;/a&gt;. The authors use longitudinal data from Indonesia and Kenya, meaning they can track the same individuals over time. This allows them to look at people who move from rural to urban areas, and hence have an identical set of human capital in both places, by definition. As their human capital is identical in both locations, if they earn more in one place than another then this indicates a difference in their human capital productivity, and not a difference in some unobservable human capital. So when people move from rural to urban, or urban to rural places in these countries, do their wages change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, they do not. Once you are effectively comparing the same person in two different places (i.e. using individual fixed effects) the authors find a zero gap in wages. If they compare individuals who switch between agriculture and non-agriculture (as opposed to rural vs urban), there is also effectively no wage gap. The wages of individuals do not change when they move sector of employment or from rural areas to cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kenya, some small gaps remain, but they are small compared to the raw difference in wages between areas. There seems to be about a 13% wage premium to either living in an urban area or working in non-agriculture, even for an otherwise identical individual. That number, though, is not a statistically significant estimate, so it could be zero (or it could be a 20 or 30% gap, we don’t know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HHKLM paper is consistent with the earlier research, in that when you just look at the average wage gap (i.e. labor productivity) between urban and rural areas in Kenya and Indonesia, it is quite large (on the order of a 60-80% wage premium for urban/non-agricultural work), but when you control for human capital, it falls. The HHKLM paper is better at controlling for human capital (because they compare people to themselves), so it validates a lot of this earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of facts tells you that there is selection out of rural/agricultural work and into urban/non-agricultural work for people with lots of human capital. There is not some distortion that prevents rural people from moving to higher wage positions, apparently, its just that all the really skilled or smart people move off the farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, the people who start rural and stay rural have the lowest levels of education. The people who start urban and stay urban have the highest levels of education. People who go either rural-to-urban or urban-to-rural have similar levels of education, and its about in the middle of the other two groups. The same holds for Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really interesting is that this pattern shows up in the Raven’s Z-scores as well. If you read Garett Jones’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2uscIem&quot;&gt;Hive Mind&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll know this is a crude, but effective, proxy for IQ. It’s a simple test that you can administer in the field, and correlates well with broader measures of intelligence (it’s a non-verbal pattern recognition test). So it’s not just that people who are lucky enough to get an education in an urban area stay there, and people unlucky enough to miss out on schooling in rural areas stay there. People with better measures of inherent smarts tend to end up in the city, or are in cities to begin with. HHKLM don’t have information on urban residents for Kenya, but the data for the rural stayers and leavers conforms to the Indonesian data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Everything that follows is all me riffing on the result in HHKLM. Don’t blame them if it doesn’t make sense.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So urban places and/or non-agricultural work looks far more productive than rural/agricultural work because the people doing the urban/non-agricultural work appear to have more human capital, both inherent (Raven’s) and acquired (school). And by explaining the gap between these areas this way, it leads back to an concept that was often invoked in the early 20th century to explain the raw productivity gap: the peasant mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As industrialization started, and these raw productivity gaps opened up for the first time, people started to speculate about why they existed if people could move back and forth relatively freely. Chayanov, in 1925, published &lt;a href=&quot;https://vertov14.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/alexander_chayanov_the_theory_of_peasant_economy.pdf&quot;&gt;The Theory of the Peasant Economy&lt;/a&gt;, which speculated about peasant farm organization. In it, he suggested that you cannot think of peasant families as acting according to typical economic logic (maximizing consumption or profits), rather they had a “peasant logic” or “peasant mentality”, which was focused on eking out enough to subsist year to year, but without much thought towards expanding, saving, or growing. One of James Scott’s earlier books, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2urVdLm&quot;&gt;The Moral Economy of the Peasant&lt;/a&gt; provides a study of peasants in southeast Asia, how their motivations were driven by subsistence constraints, and paints a similar picture to Chayanov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of those authors are sympathetic to the peasants. Others looked at the same situations and get frustrated with the peasants ignorance, stubborness, and unwillingness to experiment with new techniques or technologies. For some, it was the small-town peasant mentality that was holding back economic development. When Ted Schultz published &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2tyjVNW&quot;&gt;Transformaing Traditional Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; in 1965, he attacked both interpretations of the peasant mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, he said, peasants were very much rational maximizers, just as economics would assume. They might have additional constraints (subsistence needs) and face more uncertainty unlike “normal” people, but they were maximizing their utility nonetheless with respect to those constraints. Schultz said we should be analyzing peasants with the tools of modern economics; we did not need different theories for them. That brought development into mainstream economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in questioning the idea that peasants operated on some kind of different set of rules from other people, he attacked the idea that peasants were different at all. They were just like anyone else. The implicit assumption in Schultz’s work is that if you dropped an urban person into one of their villages, they’d make the same choices as the peasants. Peasants were not different, their environment was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if they are different? That seems to be an implication of the HHKLM study. If people are sorting themselves between rural and urban areas, or between agricultural and non-agricultural work, based on some inherent characterstic captured by the Raven score or some other aspect of their human capital, then doesn’t that imply the people in the rural areas &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; different than the people in urban areas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean that rural people are not rational maximizers, but do they come to different conclusions about how to maximize, or what to maximize? If you look at the literature in Jones’ book, you’ll see that things like the Raven score are correlated with other characteristics like patience. Does the sorting of people across locations mean that in rural areas the people are less patient, and so they decide - rationally - to invest less? Are the things that frustrated outside observers of these peasant economies - unwillingness to experiment, ignorance - a result of the selection of low Raven-score, or low human capital individuals, into those areas? Were they right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your gut reaction is “No, or course not”, I get it. So was mine. But let’s not confuse a positive (i.e. factual) finding with a normative conclusion. Finding that rural residents score low on the Raven, and that people with low Raven scores select into rural areas, should change nothing about your opinion regarding interventions to aid development/health/etc in these areas. It doesn’t change Schultz’s conclusion that aggregate development probably requires a massive investment in those rural peasant villages. But the HHKLM data do suggest that the nature of those investments, and how you design the incentives to make them, might need to be different than in urban areas. Think of it like tailoring a class to match the learning styles of different kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the HHKLM study is replicated in other contexts - which may be a big “if” - then perhaps we need to walk back some of the changes in thinking that Schultz initiated fifty years ago. Perhaps we should take seriously the idea that peasants are really different, not just in their constraints (which the development literature has explored in great depth), but in their underlying preferences as well (which has been done far less).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the Cost Disease of Services</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/What-You-Spend/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/What-You-Spend/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As my internal clock is not on internet time, I’m only now getting up a post in reaction to the death of William Baumol, who has been a consistent reference on this blog over the years. My topic page on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Productivity-Slowdown/&quot;&gt;productivity slowdown&lt;/a&gt; is in many ways an extended riff on his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can share no personal stories about the man, as I never met him. What I can do is spend some time digging through what I consider the key paper of his most famous idea, the “cost disease of services”. I’d like to think that as an academic, he’d appreciate this as much as an anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, Baumol was one of the handful of towering figures of economics who recently passed, along with Ken Arrow and Allan Meltzer. In response, I would like to suggest that someone move Robert Solow to a secure underground bunker, and encase him in bubble wrap, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Baumol. The central paper is “&lt;a href=&quot;http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Baumol1967.pdf&quot;&gt;Macroeconomics of Unbalanced Growth: The Anatomy of Urban Crisis&lt;/a&gt;”, published in 1967 in the American Economic Review. For me, this contains a handful of insights that allow you to understand much of the story of economic growth in the fifty years since it was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, Baumol divides economic activity up in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The basic source of differentiation resides in the role played by labor in the activity. In some cases labor is primarily an instrument - an incidental requisite for the attainment of the final product, while in other fields of endeavor, for all practical purposes the labor is itself the end product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first case, labor as an instrument, you can read “manufactured goods”. He uses the example of an air conditioner. Just by looking at the A/C unit, or using it, there is no way for you to assess how much labor went into producing it. The labor is just incidental from your perspective as a consumer of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are a number of servics in which the labor is an end in itself, in which quality is judged directly in terms of amount of labor. Teaching is a clear-cut example … An even more extreme example is one I have offered in another context: live performance. A half hour horn qunitet calls for for the expenditure of 2 1/2 man hours in its performance, and any attempt to increase productivity here is likely to be viewed with concern by critics and audience alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, labor is the very essence of the product. If you go see the horn quintet, then you are buying the 1/2 of each of those players time. Likewise, for a class you are in many ways buying the teachers time. At a (nice) restaurant, you are often purchasing the time and attention of a waiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big conclusion, which is really an assumption of Baumol’s, is that labor productivity growth in the first kind of production (goods) is relatively fast, while labor productivity growth in the second kind (services) is relatively slow. This is just due to the nature of the work involved. For most services, you cannot do “more with less”. No one wants to see the 1/2 hour horn quintet played in only 12 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does the cost disease come in? The next crucial assumption Baumol makes is that labor costs (wages) in the two kinds of activities move together. To be clear, he doesn’t assume (or need to assume) that wages are identical in the two sectors, only that a wage increase in one sector puts upward pressure on wages in the other sector. This would be the case if labor was somewhat mobile between the two activities. Another way of saying this is that workers could work in either sector. (They may not be equally productive in both sectors, as in Alwyn Young’s recent paper, which raises the possibility that Baumol is wrong about relative productivity growth. Maybe go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Roy/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and his paper after you finish this one.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re done. Productivity growth in the goods sector raises the wage in that sector, but also raises the output of that sector. So the ratio of wage to output - a measure of the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; of a unit of output - stays constant over time. Higher wages in the goods sector put pressure on wages in the service sector, so wages rise over time there. But (taking the exteme position) productivity is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; growing in services, and so &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; is not growing. The ratio of wages to output in services - a measure of &lt;em&gt;costs&lt;/em&gt; - is thus rising over time. This is the “cost disease of services”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial elements are, again, the assumption that labor productivity growth is relatively slow in services, and the assumption that labor is mobile between sectors. Given this, the cost of services will rise over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my money, the biggest insight Baumol had was to to notice the differential in how labor matters to production in goods and services. The subsequent logic is, by itself, not a major breakthrough. The Balassa/Samuelson effect - developed by those authors in articles published in 1964 - is the same idea. They distinguish between tradable and non-tradable goods, rather than goods and services per se, and they are thinking about a cross-sectional comparisons of countries, rather than one country over time, but the outcome is identical. Countries that are very productive in tradable goods will tend to have high aggregate price levels (an empirical regularity known as the “Penn Effect”), as that productivity drives up costs in their non-tradable sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is worth noting that labels matter. If you call this “cost disease”, it sounds like a problem. If you call this “the Penn Effect”, it means that rich countries have higher prices, and is just an empirical oddity. “Cost disease” sounds bad, but is a lot like dying in your 90’s from old age. It’s awful that you are dying, but let’s not overlook that you made it into your 90’s. Baumol’s cost disease is a result of incredible affluence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise symptoms of the cost disease depend on further assumptions. Baumol traced out the possibilities in the rest of the paper. We have that the costs (and thus prices) of the service sector are rising relative to the goods sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We may inquire what would happen if despite the change in their relative costs and prices the magnitude of the relative outputs of the two sectors were maintained … if the demand for the product in question (&lt;em&gt;services - DV&lt;/em&gt;) were sufficiently price inelastic or income elastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the next essential insight, which is that demand for services is price inelastic and/or income elastic. What this means is that despite the rising costs, people continue to consume services, and may in fact &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; their expenditure on services as they get more expensive. Baumol traces out the implications of the demand for services on the aggregate economy. In the following quote, the “progressive sector” is the goods sector, with rising productivity, and the “nonprogressive sector” is services, with slow productivity growth. Italics are Baumol’s original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If productivity per man hour rises cumulatively in one sector relative to its rate of growth elsewhere in the economy, while wages rise commensurately in all areas, then relative costs in the nonprogressive sectors must inevitably rise, &lt;em&gt;and these costs will rise cumulatively and without limit&lt;/em&gt;. … Thus, the very progress of the technologically progressive sectors inevitably adds to the costs of the technologically unchanging sectors of the economy, unless somehow the labor markets in these areas can be sealed off and wages held absolutely constant, a most unlikely possibility. We see then that costs in many sectors of the economy will rise relentlessly, and will do so for reasons that are for all practical purposes beyond the control of those involved. … If their relative outputs are maintained, an ever increasing proportion of the labor force must be channeled into these activities and the rate of growth of the economy must be slowed correspondingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to summarize this in my own words three or four times, but I don’t think I did a better job than Baumol. Many posts on this blog have been about the realization of Baumol’s prediction regarding slowing productivity growth as we transition into the non-progressive sectors. I’ll just reiterate that the slowdown in aggregate growth implied by Baumol’s cost disease is driven by the nature of demand, not a technological limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often people interalize the cost disease part of Baumol’s paper, without taking into consideration the second part regarding the effect of the demand for services. Scott Alexander has a recent post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/&quot;&gt;cost disease&lt;/a&gt; from a few months ago that demonstrates this. Alexander’s post is not unique, it just happened to be the last thing in my reading list on this topic, and so I’m using it to illustrate a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a (very) long post, but Alexander goes through education, health, and government services, effectively documenting the cost disease. He crystallizes this by asking the following kind of question. “Which would you prefer? Sending your child to a 2016 school? Or sending your child to a 1975 school, and getting a check for $5000 each year?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then does this with college; modern college, or your parent’s college plus 72,000 dollars? And then with health care; modern health care, or your parent’s health care (plus ACE inhibitors and some other now off-patent technologies) plus 8000 dollars each year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander’s implicit answer to all these questions is that you would choose the the second option; the older level of service plus the cash. Much of the post is spent explaining that the service offered today is of no better quality than the service offered a generation ago. And while I’d quibble with that broad conclusion, that’s not the point. Let’s stipulate that the quality of healthcare and education have not changed in a generation, which is like taking Baumol’s thought experiment as a precise statement about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the question that Baumol implicitly asked himself. What do people spend all that extra money on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could use it towards a new car or a major appliance, both manufactured goods. Perhaps this is what Alexander has in mind; he never says what he thinks happens to the extra money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they might spend that extra five or eight thousand dollars to finally take a well-deserved vacation, meaning it is spent on tourism and hospitality services. Or they may well decide to spend that money sending their kids to a better (and more expensive?) school, or putting them in a full time daycare rather than part-time. Or in sending one of their kids to college who might not otherwise have gone. Perhaps the savings are used to send someone back to get a Master’s degree to get a promotion at work, or acquire a new certification that increases their wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of those savings might be spent on health services. Individuals may undertake procedures to permanently deal with chronic problems rather than only alleviating symptoms. Maybe the kids get full orthodontic treatment, rather than the partial work that only straightened one tooth. The savings Alexander proposes could be spent on seeing specialists to deal with persistent health issues, rather than relying on a GP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Baumol’s second insight, the demand for these kinds of services is &lt;em&gt;income elastic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;price inelastic&lt;/em&gt;. Which means that a huge part of the money people get back from Alexander’s thought experiment is plowed &lt;em&gt;right back into education and healthcare&lt;/em&gt;. What does that do? It shifts the demand curve out for healthcare and education. And then what happens? The price goes up, and the actual amount of new health care or education acquired is not that large. Moreover, there is no appreciable decline - and there may be an increase - in the share of total GDP accounted for by healthcare and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same outcome Baumol described, even though for him the origin of this was a productivity increase in the goods sector. But the origin of the productivity increase is unimportant, what matters is the structure of demand for services. So long as our demand for services is income elastic and price inelastic, the share of healthcare and education in GDP are going to rise as we get more productive, no matter where that productivity improvement comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a claim that healthcare or education are efficiently run, by the way. I can list, off the top of my head, a good five or six university administrators that I would get rid of tomorrow without any noticable effect. We could spend the next week swapping stories of ridiculous medical bills for $20 band-aids and the like. But their high costs are not entirely due to deliberate inefficiency, and lowering these costs would not lower their share of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Alexander’s post is one example (of many) taking the “disease” part of “cost disease” too literally. Rising costs in education and healthcare do not always represent a pathology. In a lot of ways we are the victims of our own prosperity and preferences here. There is nothing about Baumol’s analysis that implies living standards are lower or welfare is impaired by the cost disease. Remember that the cost disease is a consequence of productivity improvements in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “cost disease” may not have been the best choice of names, Baumol has to be credited with anticipating the path of economic growth and structural change in developed countries over the late 20th century. He did this without resorting to any math beyond what I could use in an intermediate college course, and in language accessible to anyone. If you’re interested in economic growth, it is well worth finding some time to sit down are read through his body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sigh....No, tax cuts won&#39;t boost growth</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Taxes-Growth/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Taxes-Growth/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess we need to go over this again. No, cuts to corporate tax rates and/or the reforms/cuts proposed on individual income taxes will not boost economic growth in any appreciable way. Not to 4%, nor 4.5%, nor 5%. There is no evidence supporting this claim. And even theoretically, there is no reason to believe that these tax reforms/cuts can boost growth to those rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prima-facie-evidence&quot;&gt;Prima Facie Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a simple smell test. The figure below plots two series: the backward-looking 5-year average growth rate of real GDP and the forward-looking 5-year growth rate of real GDP. For example, in 1981, the backward looking series is the average growth rate of real GDP from 1976-1981, and the forward looking series is the average growth rate of real GDP from 1981-1986. For any given year on the graph, we can compare the growth rate people had experienced in the recent past (backward looking) to what they would experience in the near future (forward looking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_growth_tax.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth and Taxes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on the figure are red lines indicating when significant tax legislation was passed, and whether it was considered a tax cut, or a tax increase. 1981 and 1986 are the “Reagan tax cuts”, 1990 is the Bush tax increase, 1993 is the Clinton budget agreement that raised top tax rates, 2001 and 2003 are the younger Bush tax cuts, and included the 2012 “fiscal cliff” agreement under Obama that raised taxes on those earning over 400,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can look at is whether the forward-looking growth rate differed appreciably from the backward-looking one. If the argument about tax cuts stimulating growth is correct, then you’d expect to see that the forward-looking rate exceeds the backward-looking rate. In 1981, this looks true. Growth from 1981-1986 was about 3.5% per year, versus 2.8\% per year in 1976-1981. But examining the other tax cuts, you’ll see the opposite is true. In 1986, growth was slower &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the tax cut than before. In 2001 and 2003, growth is lower &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the tax cut than before. For the 2003 cut, the difference is very striking because of the onset of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, look at the three tax increases. For Bush (the elder) in 1990, there was essentially no difference in the forward and backward growth rate. For the 1993 increase, growth was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; higher after the tax increase than before, and for the 2012 increase we’d need to get data through the end of 2017 to make the same comparison. But for what it is worth, growth in the four years from 2012-2016 has been a shade over 2%, meaning it is much higher than the five years prior to the tax increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot take this as any kind of definitive proof of anything, of course. Tax cuts &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; boost growth, but each time we passed a tax cut it just so happens that some other big negative shock hit the economy at the same time, masking those positive effects. That’s … possible. The more likely answer is just that substantial tax cuts have small effects on economic growth. On the other side, the last time we averaged 4% growth over a 5-year period was the late 1990’s, right after the tax increase of 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the smell test, this isn’t a new question, and people have picked around at the relationship of tax rates and growth rates before. I reviewed a few studies in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/taxes-and-growth/&quot;&gt;early post&lt;/a&gt; here on the blog. Short answer, there is no relationship of the tax rate to the growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this same question on from a narrower pespective, Menzie Chinn has a recurring series of posts tracking Kansas’ economic growth and employment since Brownback became governor and signed off on a massive tax cut. The short version of these posts is that employment and growth in Kansas has stagnated and/or outright fell since the cut. There are several similarities between the Kansas cut and the one proposed by the current administration. Most notably, lowering the tax rate on “pass-through” income from partnerships and proprietorships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2017/04/kansas-employment-rises-to-0-3-below-previous-peak&quot;&gt;Kansas employment rises to 0.3% below peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2017/03/kansas-employment-decline-continues-2&quot;&gt;Kansas employment decline continues (part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2016/12/trends-in-kansas-gdp&quot;&gt;Trends in Kansas GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2016/12/kansas-employment-decline-continues&quot;&gt;Kansas employment decline continues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2016/10/the-kansas-economy-three-pictures&quot;&gt;The Kansas economy: three pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econbrowser.com/archives/2016/10/more-on-the-kansas-employment-collapse&quot;&gt;More on the Kansas employment collapse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower tax rate on pass-through income was supposed to generate a burst of growth in Kansas. The TL;DR version of Menzie’s posts is that it hasn’t happened, which you can probably tell from the post titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-dont-tax-cuts-boost-growth-by-much&quot;&gt;Why don’t tax cuts boost growth by much?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, the evidence doesn’t support the idea that tax cuts boost growth, but at least &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; it’s true, right? Kinda sorta. Smarter people than I have tried to estimate how sensitive people’s work efforts are to income tax rates, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-slemrod-giertzJEL12.pdf&quot;&gt;they find&lt;/a&gt; very, very small effects. The main effect of changes in tax rates and/or reforms is that people with the means to do so shift the legal definition of their income (e.g. from personal income to profits at a proprietorship). The effect on hours worked is very small, and that is the margin we’d care about if we want to study economic growth. From the corporate side, there isn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://eml.berkeley.edu/~yagan/DividendTax.pdf&quot;&gt;any evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the 2003 dividend tax cut had any effect on corporate investment, or on labor earnings. Rather, the dividend tax cut generated a substantial amount of payouts to existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s say that these guys are all wrong, and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; tax reform/cut proposed by the current administration is * different&lt;em&gt;. For realsies, it is going to incent lots of firms to invest more, employ more people, and stimulate the economy. *That&lt;/em&gt; is going to boost growth to 4%, or maybe more, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong. The issue is that the effects of any tax cut are going to take time to manifest themselves. In particular, corporate tax cuts that have the stated purpose of raising investment will need years or &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; to manifest themselves in higher GDP, assuming that the savings are actually used for investment spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been over this before on this blog, and now that I have my handy Topics pages, you can go see all the gory details &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Converge-Reform/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The short story is that tax cuts/reforms change &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; GDP (possibly), and it takes a long time for us to converge from today’s GDP to that potential GDP. The analogy is to think of GDP like your weight. If you cut “taxes” on your weight by exercising less, then you will gain weight. But not all at once. It will take months or years to reach your new potential, heavier, weight. The same thing happens with GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you think the effects of these tax cuts on potential GDP are massive, which is unlikely, you can’t generate significant changes in growth rates. There are several posts on the Topics page that do this, but let me repeat the basic calculation. Real GDP in the US is just about 17 trillion (2009 chained) dollars as of Q1 2017. A generous estimate of the current growth rate of real GDP would be about 2.5% per year, without the tax cuts. Now, let’s say the proposed corporate and individual tax cuts/reforms raised &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; GDP to something like 18 trillion dollars. In other words, what if there was 1 trillion in extra economic activity that was not taking place because a bunch of people have John Galt-ed themselves out of investing or working due to the current tax system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much faster would growth in real GDP be after the proposed tax cuts/reforms? To figure this out we need one extra piece of information, the convergence rate. This rate is the percent of the gap between current GDP and potential GDP that closes every year, and it is commonly estimated to be about 2%. In the weight example, if your current weight was 150 pounds, and your potential weight is 300 pounds thanks to your cut in exercise, then this 2% convergence rate says that in the first year, you will gain .02&lt;em&gt;(300-150) = 3 pounds. And next year, you’ll gain .02&lt;/em&gt;(300-153) = 2.94 pounds. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do the same calculation for GDP, and figure out the growth rate of GDP implied by this convergence. Current GDP is 17 trillion, and potential GDP is 18 trillion, so the economy should add an extra .02&lt;em&gt;(18-17) = .02 trillion, or about 20 billion in economic activity. Now, remember, GDP was going to grow at 2.5% anyway without the tax cut. So GDP next year was going to be 1.025&lt;/em&gt;17 = 17.425 trillion. Add the extra 20 billion on top of that, to get 17.445 trillion in economic activity next year. So overall growth in GDP would be 17.445/17 - 1 = .0262, or 2.62%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s …. not 4%. Or really anywhere close. It is hard to move the growth rate of GDP, in the same way that it is hard to change the heading of an oil tanker. But maybe I’m just being pessimistic. So let’s play around with some numbers. What if the convergence rate is 4% per year? Then growth would be 2.73% next year. What if the convergence rate is 10%? 3.09% growth. Which is still not 4% per year, and there is no evidence that the convergence rate is 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re worried I’m underselling the effects of the tax cut itself. So let’s say that the proposed reforms raise the potential GDP of the US to 19 trillion - which is ridiculous by the way - but whatever. With a 2% convergence rate, that would lead to a growth rate of … 2.73%. How about potential GDP of 20 trillion, meaning that tax rates &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; are keeping GDP &lt;em&gt;three trillion&lt;/em&gt; under where it could. Then growth might hit … 2.85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue here is that it takes time for all that pent-up investment (if it exists) to manifest itself. Firms cannot expand production overnight. It takes time to generate the plans for a new location, or plant, or product. And this all assumes, contrary to the available evidence, that there are substantial effects of tax cuts or reforms on the willingness of firms to invest and/or people to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no magic elixir of tax rules that will generate 4% growth. You don’t need to see anything more than the one-page outline put out by the current administration to get to this conclusion. Filling in the details will not change the fact that their plan, if passed, will have no appreciable effect on economic growth in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Topics-Pages/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Less of a post, and more of an announcement. I just created some new pages here at Growthecon.com that collect resources and materials related to specific topics regarding growth. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/topics/&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/a&gt; link in the header of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an exercise in intellectual housecleaning, and a way to organize some materials for possible use in classes in the future. Each topic has links to my own posts on the subject, links to other web articles or resources, and some selected academic citations. The topics are thus more accessible, but less comprehensive, then the pages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/references/&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; that are also posted on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the topics include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Are-We-Rich/&quot;&gt;Are we rich?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Converge-Reform/&quot;&gt;Can you reform your way to higher growth?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Comp-Assumptions/&quot;&gt;Does growth depend on competition?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Dev-Growth/&quot;&gt;Does economic growth mean economic development?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Productivity-Slowdown/&quot;&gt;Productivity slowdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Manuf-Special/&quot;&gt;Is manufacturing special?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Robots-Jobs/&quot;&gt;Robots and jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Inst-Geography/&quot;&gt;Deep determinants of development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Growth-Nature/&quot;&gt;Does economic growth harm the environment?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a decent start, and there may be a few more topics to show up. The first job is probably to split the topic on productivity slowdown into separate pieces, maybe just on measuring TFP, and then on the Baumol effects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aggregate Productivity versus Aggregate Technology ... Again</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/TFP-With-Profits/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/TFP-With-Profits/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You can file this as another example of how measured aggregate TFP growth is like a trash can. It happens to include aggregate technology (which got tossed in there by accident while cleaning up kitchen), but also all sorts of other junk (like leftover coffee grounds). Today’s example shows that even if you are smart about how you construct your measure of aggregate TFP growth, you can still end up with some garbage in there because of aggregation issues. I know this is pushing the analogy, but actually measuing aggregate &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; is like trying to wipe up just the waffle crumbs your kids left behind, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the drops of syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try to give the English-language, and non-garbage related, version of this before turning to the math. To calculate TFP growth, we look at how fast aggregate GDP grew relative to how fast aggregate input use grew. But there is a discrepancy about how we measure GDP growth and how we measure input growth. Aggregate GDP growth is a summation of the growth rate of each individual sector, with each weighted by how big a part of GDP they are. Manufacturing is about 12% of GDP, so a 3% growth rate of manufacturing output would add 0.12 x 0.03 = 0.0036 to total GDP growth, or about one-third of one percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, aggregate input growth is the summation of the growth rate of inputs of each individual sector, but with each weighted by how big a part of total &lt;em&gt;costs&lt;/em&gt; they are. So if manufacturing is about 10% of total costs, a 2% growth rate of input use would add 0.10 x 0.02 = 0.002 to total input growth, or about one-fifth of one percentage point. Why costs, and not GDP? We want our measure of total input growth to reflect how inputs are really used across sectors, not how output is valued across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’re measuring aggregate GDP growth by weighting sectors by their share of GDP, but measuring input growth by weighting sectors by their share of costs, we’ve created a problem. If there are differences in market power (and hence profits) between sectors, then a sector’s share of GDP is no longer equal to its share of costs. For a sector with a big profit share, it would look over-weighted in GDP growth, but under-weighted in input growth. If its input use is growing, this will show up as &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; aggregate TFP growth. The opposite case can also happen. If we have a sector with a very small profit share, it will look under-weighted in GDP growth, but over-weighted in input growth. If it has rapid input growth, this will show up as &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; aggregate TFP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But neither case reflects any actual technological change. We’re just moving inputs from one sector to another. Once we start aggregating sectors, all the differences in market power between sectors are going to stick to aggregate TFP like the drops of syrup to the waffle crumbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This holds true even though we’re being really smart about how we calculate the input growth, and I was reminded of this in class when a student presented a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v3y2011i2p29-74.html&quot;&gt;John Fernald and Brett Neiman&lt;/a&gt; that happens to be about Singapore. They construct a measure of aggregate TFP growth, and show how it contains both aggregate technology growth but also an adjustment term that picks up on these differences between sectors in their cost and GDP shares. This is true despite the fact that using cost shares for input growth is the right thing to do (as opposed to just using the GDP shares over again, basically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows next is the math behind this, and then I’ll pick up again on the English explanation and try to think through how this might be applicable to the US productivity slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-math&quot;&gt;In Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s back up a step, to review what the issue may be. If I want to calculate a measure of TFP growth, then I want to calcualte the difference between the growth rate of output and the growth rate of “inputs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\% \Delta TFP = \% \Delta GDP - \% \Delta Inputs&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But constructing the growth rate of inputs is non-trivial. There are multiple inputs (capital and labor, at least), and so I need some way to sum up the growth rate of all the inputs into a single measure of the growth rate of inputs. Basically, I need to subtract off the growth rates of all the inputs, but I need to scale each of them by how important they are to production. To be more precise,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\% \Delta TFP = \% \Delta GDP - \omega_K \% \Delta K - \omega_L \% \Delta L&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I’m assuming there are two inputs, capital and labor. The &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_K\inline&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt; measure how important each is to production. I need those because a 10% increase in capital, for example, doesn’t translate directly into a 10% increase in GDP, because of diminishing returns. I want the &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_K\inline&quot;/&gt; to capture these diminishing returns, meaning I want the elasticity of GDP with respect to capital. And there is a similar story for labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before here that a traditional way of measuring these is to assume that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt; is equal to labor’s share of GDP, meaning total wages divided by GDP, and that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_K\inline&quot;/&gt; is just &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1 - \omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt;. This would be fine only under some very specific conditions: zero profits and constant returns to scale. And the world might not work that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more robust way of doing this is to use the capital’s share of total &lt;em&gt;costs&lt;/em&gt; to measure &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_K\inline&quot;/&gt;, and labor’s share of total &lt;em&gt;costs&lt;/em&gt; to measure &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt;. This doesn’t require an assumption about either profits or constant returns to scale. All we need to believe is that firms are cost-minimizers. With cost minimizers, the cost share of an input will be equal to the elasticity of GDP with respect to that input, and we’re all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that we might not be good. The problem is that when we have multiple sectors (or firms), to add up to find the growth rate of GDP, we use each sector’s share of GDP as a weight. For an example, I’m going to go with two sectors, manufacturing and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\% \Delta GDP = \frac{P_M Y_M}{GDP}  \% \Delta Y_M + \frac{P_S Y_S}{GDP}  \% \Delta Y_S&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger the fraction of GDP made up of services, for example, the more important the growth rate of services is for aggregate growth in GDP. If you’re unsure about that, just ask yourself what the growth rate of GDP would be if there were no manufacturing sector, only services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the measure of TFP growth, I still need those &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_K\inline&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt; weights. And for those weights I need the cost share of capital and labor at the &lt;em&gt;aggregate&lt;/em&gt; level. To calculate the aggregate cost share of capital, for example, I would use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\omega_K = \frac{Costs_M}{Costs}\frac{RK_M}{Costs_M} + \frac{Costs_S}{Costs}\frac{RK_S}{Costs_S}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where R is the rental rate of capital, and &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K^M\inline&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K^S\inline&quot;/&gt; are the actual amounts of capital used by manufacturing and services. Writing it this way, the ratio &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RK^M/Costs^M\inline&quot;/&gt; is the share of capital in the costs of manufacturing, and similar for services. But I weight those by manufacturing’s (or service’s) share of total costs. Again, the effect of an individual sector depends on how big it is in the economy, except now we measure that size by costs, not by GDP. There is an essentially identical equation for &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\omega_L\inline&quot;/&gt;, only using total wages instead of the total cost of capital within each sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start to get a flavor of the problem now. We are aggregating GDP growth by using shares of &lt;em&gt;GDP&lt;/em&gt;, but we are aggregating cost shares by using shares of &lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt;. This is a problem once we have either sector earning profits, and thus their share of GDP is not the same thing as their share of costs. In particular, if manufacturing (say) earns profits, then its share of GDP is necessarily bigger than its share of total costs. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_M Y_M / GDP &amp;gt; Costs_M/Costs\inline&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fernald and Neiman work out just the effect that this has on measured TFP growth. To kind of match their analysis, and because it helps simplify, let’s assume that manufacturing earns profits, while services do not. Then what they show is that you can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\% \Delta TFP = \% \Delta Technology + \frac{s_{\Pi}}{1-s_{\Pi}}\left(1 - \frac{P_M Y_M}{GDP}\right)\left( \% \Delta Inputs_M -  \% \Delta Inputs_S \right).&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth rate of &lt;em&gt;measured&lt;/em&gt; TFP (the thing on the left) combines two terms. The first term on the right is the “true” growth rate of technology. The second term captures the effect of having sectors with different profit shares. We can take each part of that second term in turn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_{\Pi}/1-s_{\Pi}\inline&quot;/&gt;: This is the ratio of profits to costs in the aggregate economy. The larger this is, the bigger an impact this adjustment to TFP growth gets. This ratio will be relatively big when manufacturing is a big fraction of the economy, and relatively small when manufacturing is a small fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1 - P_M Y_M/GDP\inline&quot;/&gt;: This captures how important manufacturing is in the economy. If manufacturing made up all of GDP, then this whole second term would disappear, as the aggregate economy would look exactly like the manufacturing sector. But the smaller is manufacturing, the bigger the effect this term has.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\% \Delta Inputs_M -  \% \Delta Inputs_S\inline&quot;/&gt;: I know I dropped in some new notation here. This is the difference in the growth rate of total input use in manfucturing and services. Technically, there are separate terms in here referring to capital and labor, but this does the job. This last difference is what determines whether the whole second term is positive or negative. If input use in manufacturing is growing faster than in services, then this term would be positive, and it would make measured aggregate TFP growth higher. On the other hand, if services have higher input growth, then measured aggregate TFP growth would be lower.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-english&quot;&gt;Back to English&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the math confirms (I hope), is that aggregate TFP growth depends not only on aggregate technology, but also an adjustment for whether input use is growing faster in a high-profit sector (i.e. manufacturing) or a low-profit sector (i.e. services). To the extent that services have faster input growth, measured TFP growth will be &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; than actual technology growth. This is because input use in services is a little over-weighted compared to manufacturing, but the share of GDP in services is a little under-weighted. When inputs flow into services, it is like we are counting the input use more than we count the GDP growth that comes with it, and since TFP growth is just GDP growth minus input growth, it looks like TFP is growing more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is an additional effect of moving into services, over and above the plausible story that services have relatively low “true” technological growth. It’s also complete speculation, because I’m just spitballing this idea that the profits in manufacturing are larger than services. It might make more sense to just think about high-profit and low-profit sectors, and ask if inputs are shifting from the former into the latter. Either way, once you’ve got sectors tha differ in their profit shares, your measure of aggregate TFP growth has this possible problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the lesson here is that you really cannot use only aggregate data if you want a measure of aggregate technology growth. You will always run into the garbage can issue. If you want a measure of aggregate technology growth, you should calculate technological growth for each individual unit (firm or sector) separately, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; add those up, if you want any chance. Since I know you were hoping for another breakfast food analogy, imagine using a tweezers to pick up each individual crumb of waffle to ensure you do not touch any syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Update on the Profits from Housing</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Ricardian-Housing/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Ricardian-Housing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Profit-Accounting/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I used some findings by &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.uchicago.edu/~barkai/&quot;&gt;Simcha Barkai&lt;/a&gt; and the BLS to infer that housing may a major source of the rise in the share of profits in GDP. I got an e-mail from Simcha regarding the post, and the upshot is that I’m wrong. First, and foremost, it turns out that I got confused reading his paper, and all his calculations &lt;em&gt;exclude&lt;/em&gt; residential housing. This means that my inference from comparing the BLS profit share to his profit share is invalid. You cannot conclude that residential housing profits are driving a rise in profits share of aggregate GDP, because there is no information on housing in Barkai’s number. He documents that the profit share of the non-financial corporate sector is rising over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my bad on that. Simcha also made a point in his e-mail about how the BLS calculates profit shares, and it makes me lean towards his calculations as being correct. But let’s leave that for another day and post. For the time being, you should go forth and freak out about the increasing profit share in the non-financial corporate sector, whatever your preferred explanation for that may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had housing on the brain, though, so I wanted to figure whether I was wrong about profits rising in the housing sector. Effectively, I’d like to recreate Barkai’s analysis, but now for the housing sector only. To figure that out, I need to look at the data on the stock of residential housing capital (K), and the imputed flow of value-added from housing (Y). The other thing I need to calculate is the required rate of return on housing (R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the stock and flow, which I pulled down from FRED. The stock, K, is the “Current-Cost Net Stock of Fixed Assets: Residential” from the national income accounts. That includes all privately owned residential assets, which encompasses both owner-occupied and tenant-occupied. The flow, Y, is “Gross housing value added”, which comes from Table 1.3.5 of the national accounts. This is the BEA’s estimate of the total flow of housing services (including imputed rents for owner-occupied housing) minus the cost of any intermediate goods. Those intermediates would include maintenance and repairs on your house, or the cost of property management services if you owned a rental building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_housing_ky.png&quot; alt=&quot;Housing YK&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first figure is the ratio of Y/K, or roughly the average product of housing capital. On average, the flow of housing services is equal to around 8% of the stock of housing. But there are clear fluctuations, with a big dip after WWII, and then subsequent dips around 1980 and 2009. But there is also a tendency for the ratio Y/K to rise from WWII to today, from maybe 6% to 9%. This tendency of Y/K to &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; means that the ratio of K/Y is going to &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;, and that is going to matter in my little profit share calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want profit’s share of the flow of housing output. I’m going to assume that no labor is used in providing housing services. Don’t get freaked out by that, the flow of housing services is not the same thing as construction. Construction - which does use lots of labor - is the flow of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; housing (or other structures) into the stock. What we’re talking about here is the flow of services provided by &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; housing, which does not involve much labor at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I am assuming that the flow of housing can be split as follows, &lt;strong&gt;Y = RK + Profits&lt;/strong&gt;. In shares, this is just &lt;strong&gt;1 = RK/Y + Profits/Y&lt;/strong&gt;. If I know RK/Y, I can figure out the profit share easily. Note that RK/Y depends on K/Y, which was falling over time, based on the prior figure. So that, by itself, suggests the profit share was rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it seems likely that R was falling over time. If you remember from the prior post, we could write &lt;strong&gt;R = i - g + d&lt;/strong&gt;, where R is the return on capital, i is the nominal interest rate, g is the expected inflation in the capital price, and d is depreciation. For i, the obvious choice here is the mortgage rate. I (or rather FRED) does not have mortgage rate data going back as far as 1930, but it does have it for the 1970’s forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_housing_mort.png&quot; alt=&quot;Housing Mortgage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a big surprise that mortgage rates have fallen over time, much like any other nominal interest rate. They’re under 5% now, from a high of around 17% in 1981. By itself, this is going to drive R lower over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other information I need is on g and d. I’ve played around a lot with these, and I can’t come up with any reasonable assumptions about them that can overcome the drop in nominal mortgage rates over time. That is, if you really wanted to make R go &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; over time, you’d need people to believe that housing prices were going to &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt; significantly (so g&amp;lt;0) or that depreciation rates on houses have risen significantly over time. I can’t get my head around how either of those could be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the figure I’ll show below, I’m assuming that g = 3% at all times (not true) and d = 1% at all times (not true). I’m not going to get hung up on the actual numbers, because what we’re interested in is the change in R over time, not the actual level. It’s also a blog post, not a paper. So take the data on the mortgage rate, and combine that with my assumption on g and d to get a measure of R over time. Use that R, and combine it with the data on K/Y, and you’ve got a time series for RK/Y. With that time series, you can solve for &lt;strong&gt;Profits/Y = 1 - RK/Y&lt;/strong&gt;, and I’ve got my profit share in housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_housing_profit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Housing Mortgage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to get your eyes off the gigantic negative number in 1981. According to this calculation, the profit share on housing was negative 100%. To be more concrete, what this is saying is that the rent you could get on a house (Y) in 1981 was equal to about half of the cost of the mortgage (RK). You were implicitly losing money owning a home, but if it was owner-occupied, you were losing money to yourself. That dramatic negative profit share is a function of the spike in mortgage rates during the Volcker disinflation, and as I said, it is hard to see around it in the figure. But notice that the profit share started to climb around 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_housing_profit90.png&quot; alt=&quot;Housing Mortgage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the 1990-2016 period out to show the evolution of the profit share more clearly. Here the rise in the profit share is apparent, from about 20 to about 80% from 1990 to 2016. I don’t want to get too stuck on the precise level of these numbers, which depend in part on my assumption regarding 3% expected house price inflation and 1% depreciation. But the trend is clear. Because of the decline in the mortgage rate, the cost of owning a home fell, but the flow of output produced by houses did not. In essence, you can rent out your owner-occupied home for more than you’d pay in mortgage costs, and you are profiting. You may be paying those profits to yourself, but there is a profit involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s round this back to the discussion of profit shares in the wider economy. Barkai found that the profit share is rising in the private, non-housing, sector. My mini-analysis here suggests that the profit share in the housing sector is rising as well. Combined, that means the profit share in aggregate GDP is rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference from the last post is that the rise in housing profits is not mutually exclusive with the rise in profts in the private, non-housing, sector. The source of the rise in profits is similar in both cases, as it turns out. The drop in nominal interest rates means that the required return for capital (housing or non-housing) is falling over time, but the flow of output produced in part by that capital is not, so the profit share is rising.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Housing Driving the Rise in Profits?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Profit-Accounting/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Profit-Accounting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Um, this has nothing to do with health care or repealing the ACA. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Markups/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; was on the profit share in GDP. I drew on some work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.uchicago.edu/~barkai/&quot;&gt;Barkai&lt;/a&gt;, who calculated that the profit share in GDP had been rising steadily over the last thirty years. To save you the bother of clicking any links, here is his figure showing the profit share over time, rising from about 2.5% of GDP in 1985 to over 15% in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/barkai3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Barkai figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I also did some &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-changing-composition-of-productivity-growth/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; about how the BLS calculates multi-factor productivity. As part of that the BLS also provides a breakdown of GDP into payments to labor, capital, and profits. Here’s that figure, which runs back to 1950.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_output_share.png&quot; alt=&quot;BLS figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format of the two figures isn’t the same, but I don’t believe it is too hard to see that there is a significant difference in the profit share of output in the two analyses. There is, for all intents and purposes, no increase in the profit share using the BLS data, while Barkai finds that dramatic increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can explain the difference? To answer that, I have to dig into how both sources construct their estimates of the profit share. The method is similar between the two, but they differ in the data they use, so it turns out that the difference is all in the data, and that will have an interesting implication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calculating-profits-share-of-output&quot;&gt;Calculating Profits Share of Output&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me outline the method they use, and why. Both the BLS and Barkai want to decompose output into something like &lt;strong&gt;Output = Wages + Capital Payments + Profits&lt;/strong&gt;. This would be easy if national income accounts reported those three separate components, but they don’t. National accounts will tell you that &lt;strong&gt;Output = Wages + Proprietors Income + Rental Income + Corporate Profits + Net Interest + Taxes on production&lt;/strong&gt;. Accounting-wise, it must be that &lt;strong&gt;Capital Payments + Profits = Proprietors Income + Rental Income + Corporate Profits + Net Interest + Taxes on production&lt;/strong&gt;, but there is no way to know how big Capital Payments and Profits are from this. No, “Corporate Profits” are not equal to Profits. The former is &lt;em&gt;accounting&lt;/em&gt; profits, and the latter refers to &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both the BLS and Barkai, the solution to getting economic profits is to combine data on the total capital stock, K, with an assumption about the return to capital, R. The Capital Payments are then defined as RK, and once you know the Capital Payments, you can back out the Profits. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;Profits = Output - Wages - RK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Barkai, the value of K is taken directly from the BEA. That stock of capital, K, is broken down into a lot of categories and sub-categories are structures, equipment, and intellectual property. Structures include non-residential structures like warehouses, lodging (e.g. hotels), and amusement and recreation (e.g. Six Flags), among others. Structures also include residential structures like single family homes and apartment buildings. Intellectual property includes things like software, as well as (as of 2013), a capitalized value of R/D spending by different industries. Finally, equipment includes all the things that you normally think of as capital, like computer equipment, engines and turbines, metalworking equipment, ships, railroad, oil wells, and photocopiers (which get their own sub-category under “information processing equipment”, which I find humorous for some reason).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For R, he constructs an implicit rate of return, something like what you’d do if you tried to come up with the implicit rent an owner pays themselves if they own their home. He follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~rehall/Tax-Policy-AER-June-1967.pdf&quot;&gt;Hall and Jorgenson&lt;/a&gt; (1967), which assumes that investment decisions are not made randomly, but rather must reflect some economic logic, and so the rate of return R is described by &lt;strong&gt;R = i - g + d&lt;/strong&gt;. i is the nominal interest rate. g is the growth rate of the price of the capital good (capital gains), and d is depreciation. The intuition of the effect of these three terms is straightforward if you spin this around into &lt;strong&gt;i = R + g - d&lt;/strong&gt;. Think of a firm borrowing money to buy a capital good. They pay i as a nominal interest rate. That asset yields a return of R to them for using it, plus they get the capital gain (or loss) that goes along with the asset. The asset also depreciates at the rate d. In equilibrium, the cost of borrowing (i) should be equal to the benefit (R + g - d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barkai makes some assumptions to solve for R. He uses the interest rate on triple-A rated corporate bonds to stand in for the nominal interest rate i. He uses the observed inflation in the price of capital goods, available from the BEA’s data, to get his value for g. And the BEA also provides a number for the depreciation rate of different types of capital goods, based on their expected years of service, which he can use to get d. He solves for R for each of the three main types of capital goods - structures, equipment, and intellectual property - allowing each to have different values for g and d. At that point he can calculate RK for each type of capital, and then add up those total payments to get aggregate payments to capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he knows the capital payments, he can back out the Profits. And once he knows Profits, he simply calculates Profits/GDP to get profits share of output, which is what you see plotted in that first figure. There is nothing that immediately jumps out about Barkai’s method that would suggest it is wrong. Could you use a different series for the nominal interest rate? Sure. But if you jump onto the FRED database, and look at any series of nominal interest rates over time, they decline sharply from the early 1980’s until today. Is the required return to capital, R, not related to i + g - d? Maybe. But it would be weird if somehow the return paid to capital deviated a lot from that value. If the R value were in fact much &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; than what Barkai calculates, then this would lower the Capital Payments even further, and in turn make profits share rise by even more, and the deviation from the BLS data would be more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, to solve for the profit share you need to infer something about the payments to capital. What the BLS does is quite similar to Barkai. They use some different values for i, g, and d, but that isn’t what is really driving the difference in the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-drives-the-difference&quot;&gt;What drives the difference?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key distinction is in the overall scope of their analysis. For Barkai, &lt;strong&gt;Output = GDP&lt;/strong&gt;. For the BLS, &lt;strong&gt;Output = Private Business Output&lt;/strong&gt;. The distinction is, very roughly, &lt;strong&gt;GDP = Private Business Output + Government + Imputed GDP from Owner-Occupied Housing&lt;/strong&gt;. The concept of output is wider for Barkai than it is for the BLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference carries through to the capital stock that the BLS uses. For the BLS, the capital stock is a subset of the capital stock that Barkai uses. The BLS uses equipment, intellectual property, and tenant-occupied housing (e.g. apartment buildings). They exclude the stock of owner-occupied housing, which is included in Barkai’s calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically the reason Barkai gets a rising profit share is that he finds a fall in the share of GDP going to Capital Payments over time. For the BLS, the share of output going to capital, as you can see in the second figure, does not change much - and when it changes, it is offset by changes in the labor share, and so there is no big change in the profit share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does Barkai find a fall in the capital share compared to the BLS? It may be due to an increase in the imputed value of housing in GDP. This is going to be more clear if I drop in a real equation, so here we go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{(RK)^{BLS}}{Y^{BLS}} &gt; \frac{(RK)^{BLS} + (RK)^{Houses}}{Y^{BLS} + Y^{Houses}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fraction on the right is the capital share in output calculated by the BLS, where &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y^{BLS}\inline&quot;/&gt; stands for private business output. This fraction is bigger than the fraction on the right, which is meant to capture what Barkai is calculating as the capital share. In the numerator, he has both the return on capital that the BLS would capture, but also the return on capital going to owner-occupied housing. In the denominator, Barkai has “GDP”, which is - very roughly - the sum of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y^{BLS}\inline&quot;/&gt; and the imputed flow of GDP from owner-occupied housing, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y^{Houses}\inline&quot;/&gt;. For this inequality to be true, we need that the payments to capital for houses are not “too big”, but the imputed flow of GDP from owner-occupied housing, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y^{Houses}\inline&quot;/&gt; are “very big”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. If the imputed GDP from owner-occupied housing is very high, but the payments to capital required by housing are small, then by implication the &lt;em&gt;profits&lt;/em&gt; on owner-occupied housing are high. The rise in profits share seen in the Barkai paper could well be driven by the market power of house owners, and not by the market power of corporations, which is the intuitive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;profits-on-housing&quot;&gt;Profits on housing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to jive with other information. The figure below is from Matt Rognlie’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattrognlie.com/brookings_capitalshare.pdf&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;. Rognlie is looking not at the separate shares of output going to profits and capital, but rather their sum. If you like, he is interested in the share of GDP &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to labor. What he did was to decompose this total non-labor share into a part accounted for by housing, and for a part accounted for by non-housing. As you can see in the figure, the share of GDP going to housing (either as a return to capital or as profits) was increasing from 1950 to today. It rose from about 3% of GDP to about 10% in this period of time, while the share of GDP going to non-housing capital (either as a return to capital or as profits) was declining slightly. Combined, these two trends lead to a rise in the share of GDP going to capital as a whole, and was one of the key elements of Piketty’s book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rognlie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rognlie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rognlie’s decomposition is consistent with the story about rising profits in owner-occupied housing. The total amount of GDP getting paid to owners of homes is rising over time (Rognlie). But at the same time, the required rate of return on capital is falling (Barkai and BLS), which means that the &lt;em&gt;profits&lt;/em&gt; on owner-occupied housing must be rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by profits? Remember that these are &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; profits, not accounting profits. Owners of homes are not seeing an increase in their cash flow. As a home owner, I can assure you that my house does nothing but suck &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; cash, as opposed to producing it. Those economic profits are coming in the form of a higher imputed flow of GDP from my house over time. This implicit flow of value, a rent I’m charging myself, is getting cranked upwards over time, even if I don’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think about how this works out as an economic profit, consider the following example. Let’s say you can take out a mortgage at 4%. That’s the nominal interest rate i. Let’s say houses depreciate at 1% per year, and you expect capital gains on your house to be something like 2% per year. Then the required rate of return to break even would be &lt;strong&gt;R = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your house is worth 500,000, a 3% return would mean charging 15,000 in rent per year, or 1,250 per month. Now, if you look out at the market and find out that you could actually rent your house out for 2,000 per month, you are making 750 in &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; profit. The price you can charge for your house, 2,000, is higher than the marginal cost to you, 1,250. Profits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if you are paying &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; that rent or not. If your house can rent for more than the marginal cost, then you are making profits. The rise in the profit share in the Barkai analysis may be driven in part - or maybe mostly? - by the rise in the imputed value of rents going to owner occupied housing. If the BEA is overstating the value of the flows going to home-owners, fine, but then the implied increase in the profit share in Barkai’s analysis is overstated as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of an increasing profit share coming from owner-occupied housing are a lot different from the implications of an increasing profit share coming from corporate market power or concentration. I need to think a lot harder about housing, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Profits and Productivity</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Markups/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Markups/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the running topics here has been the relationship of markups and measured productivity growth. See prior efforts &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Cake/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/labors-share-profits-and-the-productivity-slowdown/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Those posts talked about how markups of price over marginal cost may skew the calculation of the growth rate of productivity. And I speculated here or there about how the falling labor share of output might show up in slower productivity growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I want to draw on some new evidence regarding the &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; in the share of profits in output, a complement to the decline in labor costs, and how that might influence measured productivity. Evidence that the profit share is rising is important, because it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; follow that a falling labor share lowers productivity growth; that was always just a possibility. With a rising profit share, though, I think you can trace a more direct line to lower measured productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evidence-on-higher-profit-shares-and-markups&quot;&gt;Evidence on higher profit shares and markups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent paper by job-market candidate &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.uchicago.edu/~barkai/&quot;&gt;Simcha Barkai&lt;/a&gt; provides new evidence that not only is labor’s share of output falling, but so is capital’s share. This combination implies that profit’s share of output is rising. And by profit, he means economic profits (i.e. rents) as opposed to accounting profits. Prior work documenting a falling labor share either punted on whether than meant a higher profit share, or implicitly assumed that it meant a higher capital share. Barkai makes the case that there has been a significant uptick in the profit share over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His first figure shows the decline in capital’s share of output. This isn’t something as easy to observe (unlike wages and employment), so there is some mild theorizing used to generate the measure of the return to capital he uses. But Barkai understands this, and a good chunk of the paper is spent exploring whether the assumptions he uses are driving this result. The fall in the capital share seems to be robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/barkai2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Capital&#39;s Share&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second figure here shows the implied rise in profit’s share of output. It is fairly close to a mirror image of the capital share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/barkai3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Profit&#39;s Share&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in the share of output being paid out as profits seems consistent with some other evidence on corporate savings. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w23133&quot;&gt;Chen, Karabarbounis, and Neiman&lt;/a&gt; document that the source of savings in the global economy has flipped from being primarily driven by households, to primarily driven by corporations. Given that investment behavior stayed relatively similar over time, this means that corporations have seen an improvement in their net lending position. That is, they went from being net debtors (borrowing money from households to buy investment goods) to net creditors (using their own money to buy investment goods).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ckn1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Savings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their figure gives you the basic story. On the left is the ratio of savings to total GDP for each sector (corporations, households, and government). You can see the rise in the corporate savings rate from 1980 to 2015 from almost 10% to close to 15%, matched by a decline in the household saving rate from almost 15% to under 10%. On the right, though, corporate investment as a fraction of total GDP has remained constant (and note that by 2015 it is smaller than corporate savings as a fraction of GDP). Note that these are global numbers, not US specific. What CKN also document is that the expanded corporate savings are not being used to pay dividends or interest. They represent a build-up of actual savings (think Apple’s cash pile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ckn2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Savings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with the Barkai result on profits. You would expect corporate savings, as a whole, to build up if the labor share was falling, which it is. But in addition, the fact that these extra savings are not being turned into interest or dividend payments would suggest that they are not just being used to pay for capital. I can’t prove anything here, but the rise in corporate savings fits with the profit share being higher. They do some further analysis with firm level data to show that for every dollar of additional corporate savings, about 32 cents ended up as cash holdings by firms (as opposed to share buybacks or debt paydowns). Again, consistent with the story of higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you could go in an interesting direction here by asking what this says about the nature of the principal-agent relationship of owners and managers. If firms really are earning more in profits, why isn’t that all turned back over to owners in the form of dividends or share buybacks? Do the managers benefit from keeping a large portion of these profits inside the corporation as cash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m not going to go in that direction. Rather, I want to see what this rise in profits implies about measured productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-effect-of-markups-on-productivity-levels&quot;&gt;The effect of markups on productivity levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms generate profits by marking up prices over marginal costs. So if profits are higher, it implies that the markup has increased. To say something about the effect that higher markups could be having on productivity, we need some conception of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; firms are able to charge a markup over marginal cost, and also some conception of what drives those markups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, we assume that firms have some market power based on …. something about them. Maybe they have a patent on a product, meaning they are the monopoly provider. Or maybe they have created some kind of brand, or reputation for quality (deserved or not), that makes people want to only buy &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; product. Think Apple. Or maybe they have some kind of locational advantage, like being a coffee shop in a busy train station. Whatever the reason, these firms have enough market power to charge a markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines the level of that markup, and why would it change? In general, the price elasticity of demand for their product is what matters here. The higher the price elasticity (the “flatter” the demand curve), the less market power a firm has, and the smaller a markup they can charge. The lower the price elasticity (the “steeper” the demand curve), the more market power a firm has, and the bigger a markup they can charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high price elasticity would be the case if there were lots of close substitutes for the product, so people were willing to abandon a firm’s specific product if the price went up just a little. Think of gas stations, which have a tiny bit of market power due to location. But lots of people would stop going to a gas station that raised its price by 1 or 2 cents per gallon. A low price elasticity would be the case if there were few substitutes for the product, or the product was a strong complement to other things people buy. Then, no matter what the firm charges, people will buy some. Think of an iPhone. Apple has convinced people - whether you believe it or not - that there is no substitute for an &lt;em&gt;iPhone&lt;/em&gt;; other smartphones just aren’t the same. So they can charge 600 bucks for one, while the marginal cost is something closer to 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the evidence says that markups have gone up, then one interpretation is that the price elasticity of demand for different goods has gone &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;. I think of this as meaning that people have gotten very picky. I want an &lt;em&gt;iPhone&lt;/em&gt;, not a Samsung. I want a double chai skim latte, not a coffee. I want a Lululemon pair of yoga pants, not the ones from Target. Just imagine that everyone has become a 13-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if markups are higher because the price elasticity of demand for individual goods is lower, what does this imply for measured productivity? Well, in most typical settings, this would lower measured productivity. Why? The low price elasticity of demand comes from a low elasticity of substitution across different products. And a low elasticity of substitution across products means that most of our inputs (labor, capital) end up thrown at the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; productive firms or sectors. Measured productivity gets pushed down in this case because of the concentration of inputs in these low productivity sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the story, then we should see this show up as Baumol’s “cost disease” symptoms. Inputs (capital and labor) should be moving into low productivity sectors, and the relative price of the output from these sectors should be rising. Here I think you’d appeal to the rapid rise in the price of child care, education, and health care, among others, to support the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up this line of thinking. The elasticity of substitution across products has declined over time. This results in (1) higher profits, as firms enjoy more market power when people are unwilling to substitute away from their products, and (2) lower measured productivity, as resources get concentrated in low productivity sectors. In this case, the higher profits are not a &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of lower productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this explanation is that it depends on changing preferences. It isn’t clear why the elasticity of substitution between products &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; broad sectors would be getting lower. I can see that perhaps we are getting less willing to substitute between goods and services as broad categories. But what would be making the elasticity of substitution between different services decline over time? More effective branding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concentration-and-market-power&quot;&gt;Concentration and Market Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative explanation to make sense of higher profits and lower productivity would be the concentration of firms within industries. Let’s say that you have a number of industries: health care, transportation, manufacturing, education, etc. And preferences are such that the output of these industries are complements, with a small elasticity of substitution across them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each industry, though, people are willing to substitute between different firms’ output. The firms engage in Cournot competition, meaning they try to pick a profit-maximizing amount to produce taking the others firms reactions into account. The basic result in a Cournot setting is that the markup charged by firms increases as the number of firms &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt;. Fewer firms, less competition, higher markups. One could read the evidence of higher profit shares from Barkai as consistent with a decline in the number of firms competing with one another within industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think this would lead to lower aggregate productivity. For the industries with fewer firms, they would produce less output, and given a constant marginal cost as in a typical Cournot set-up, this means fewer inputs used. Because the output of industries are complements, we don’t like having less output of any given industry, so in order to convince the industry to produce more, we have to jack up the price we pay. A higher price for the output of a given industry is like a lower productivity level in that industry. And because different industries are complements, aggregate productivity is weighted towards the lowest productivity industries. Concentration in a few industries will thus drag down productivity in the aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that sounded a little tortured. I’m not sold I’ve got the logic right. But thinking of Cournot competing firms embedded in a larger economy turns out to be …. not easy. At some point I will try to digest &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0211/papers/iefs.htm&quot;&gt;some work&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Neary on this, and do a better analysis. For now, let’s just say that I think that concentration leading to lower aggregate productivity (and higher profits) is a working hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-supplies-and-gdp&quot;&gt;Factor supplies and GDP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more! Productivity might be affected by the rise in markups, but even if it was not, overall GDP is going to be affected through factor supplies. Higher markups and higher profits came at the cost of a lower share of output going to capital and labor. Which means that the return to providing capital and labor is lower. And if there is any elasticity to the supply of these factors, then presumably people provided less capital and labor to the market in response to the fall in capital and labor shares. Having less capital and labor would mean that total GDP (and GDP per capita) would be lower, even if productivity were the same. If productivity were lower as well, then the effect on GDP from higher profit shares would be even larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum the whole post up, a documented rise in the profit share (either directly or as an implication of the rise in corporate savings) could well explain part of the slowdown in productivity and GDP growth of the last 20-30 years. Putting a firm number on this is beyond my ability at this point, but it seems to be worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who are you calling Malthusian?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Malthus/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Malthus/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a student ask me if I was a “Malthusian”. It’s not the first time someone has asked me that, and I’m never quite sure what to make of it. It’s always asked in a way that implies it is a belief system, similar to “Christian”, “Muslim”, or “Packer Fan”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how to reply. I’m not a Malthusian “believer”, because that isn’t a thing. But I do think that several of Malthus’ assumptions about how economies function, in particular prior to the onset of sustained growth during the 1800’s, are well founded. And those assumptions have implications that help make sense of the world in that period of time. Some of the assumptions Malthus made may still be relevant today, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is therefore an attempt to lay out what I think Malthusian means, and then I’ll touch on a few alternate uses of the term that are not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stagnation-in-living-standards&quot;&gt;Stagnation in living standards&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concept of a Malthusian economy involves two characteristics. First, living standards are negatively related to the &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt; of population. This would occur if we had some sort of fixed factor of production. Typically, one might say it was agricultural land, but you could just say resources if you like. It isn’t even important that they are truly fixed. So long as the resources are inelastic, whether due to a physical limit or because bringing them into use is prohibitively expensive, you’d satisfy the first characteristic of a Malthusian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that there is much controversy around whether this holds, in particular in the era prior to sustained growth. I cribbed the figure shown here from Oded Galor’s book, which took if from Greg Clark. When population crashes after the Black Death, wages spike. They stay high while population is low, and then fall once population rises again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/clark2001.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clark wage and population&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second characteristic is that population growth is positively related to living standards. This may be because kids are a normal good, and so fertility rises when people have higher incomes. Or it may be because health is a normal good, so people take better care of themselves (and their kids) when they have higher income. Higher fertility and/or lower mortality rates would lead to more rapid population growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe people don’t make concious choices like that. Maybe it is purely biological, and women with higher living standards (e.g. healthier diets) will bring more babies to term, and those babies will be more likely to survive to become parents themselves. It isn’t important here whether the fertility and mortality outcomes are subject to rational calculation or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malthus’ original work involved this positive relationship, and he seemed to have in mind a combination of choice and biology. His preventative checks were choices made by people to have fewer children, or marry later, in response to poor living standards (hence living standards and fertility are positively related). His positive checks were lower fertility and higher mortality that would occur somewhat automaticallywhen living standards fell sufficiently far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the first characteristic, the evidence for the second is ambiguous. The major issue is that there is little data available on fertility and mortality at the individual level from the period prior to 1800, and so it is difficult to test the relationship of those demographics with living standards. England is one of the places that has some data, and hence the debate on this tends to be over English demographics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0022050712000678&quot;&gt;Kelly and O Grada&lt;/a&gt; (2012) find evidence of preventive checks (i.e. marriage rates), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp6167.pdf&quot;&gt;Cinnirella, Klemp, and Weisdorf&lt;/a&gt; (2016) find evidence that births were spaced in response to living standards. But there are a number of studies that conclude the marriage rates were not responsive to living standards. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/28332/&quot;&gt;Crafts and Mills&lt;/a&gt; (2009), for example, conclude there is no positive check operating, and that preventive checks break down by the 1700’s. If you are looking for reasons to “dis-believe” Malthusian economics, then this is the spot. Perhaps population growth isn’t positively related to living standards after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if this characteristic holds, then you’ve got what I’d call a Malthusian economy. At this point, everything else follows. If there are only a few people, then from the first characteristic we know that living standards are high because the resources per person are high. But high living standards mean high population growth rates, so the number of people expands, and this pushes down resources per person, and hence pushes down living standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are a lot of people, then the opposite logic holds. Things are crowded, so living standards are low. Low living standards means slow population growth. When things are sufficiently crowded, it will mean negative population growth, and the population falls. Falling population means more resources per person, and so living standards rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in the system is pushing back towards some middle ground where the resource per person, and hence the living standard, is at just the right level so that population growth is zero. With no change in population, there is no change in living standards, so there is no change in population growth, so there is again no change in population. The economy becomes &lt;em&gt;stagnant&lt;/em&gt; at the living standard which delivers zero population growth. If you’d like a nice treatment of this mathematically, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003&quot;&gt;Ashraf and Galor&lt;/a&gt; (2011) is the cleanest description you’ll get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m rambling on about Malthusian economics, let me offer a few observations that are not immediately obvious from what I just described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stagnant level of living standards is not necessarily at a biological minimum.&lt;/strong&gt; Malthus, being something of an eternal pessimist, thought that living standards would be driven down to some bare minimum to survive. This isn’t a necessary conclusion from his two assumptions. Population growth can respond positively to living standards, even if the living standard at which population growth is zero is quite high. It all depends on preferences for kids. All Malthusian economies do not stagnate at the same level of living standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shocks to technology/productivity will only temporarily raise living standards, but will permanently raise population size.&lt;/strong&gt; Positive shocks to productivity raise living standards immediately for those alive, but this induces them to have more kids (or induces their kids to not die as quickly, so to speak), leading to population growth, which lowers living standards. Variation in productivity across countries will thus show up in higher population, but not necessarily in higher living standards. This is what Ashraf and Galor (2011) showed in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shows that population density is positively related to a measure of land productivity across countries in 1500 CE, consistent with the long-run effect of productivity on population size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ashrafgalor2011a.png&quot; alt=&quot;AGone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second shows that living standards (GDP per capita) are not related to the same measure of land productivity across countries in 1500 CE, consistent with no long-run effect of productivity on living standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ashrafgalor2011b.png&quot; alt=&quot;AGtwo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The adjustment back to the stagnant level of living standards can take a long time&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that a given Malthusian economy may have living standards that wander all over the place in the data. Nippe Lagerlof has a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nippelagerlof.com/research/happening/Waves_August_2016_post.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; showing that a Malthusian economy with random shocks to productivity and a realistic age structure will display living standards that do look Malthusian in the sense of being fixed and close to some stagnant level, but display waves of growth and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/nippe2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;nippe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nippe has built a tendency for all economies to move towards sustained growth, but the point is that the four different economies have waves of growth and collapse that last for decades, even though they have the exact same underlying Malthusian structure. The random shocks to living standards persist over time because of the effect on age structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you ask me if I’m a Malthusian, then I guess the answer is yes, if you mean everything I just said in this section. Now what about other uses of the term Malthusian? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;population-and-factor-prices&quot;&gt;Population and factor prices&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Malthusian has been applied at times to people who assert that changes in population size, acting through factor prices, influence social relationships. Historians like Postan and Le Roy Ladurie advance this kind of thesis, but I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2kIGVT9&quot;&gt;North and Thomas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Rise of the Western World&lt;/em&gt; may be the purest example of this, and the most known to economists. North and Thomas argue that changes in population, by changing relative wages and the bargaining power of peasants, were instrumental in changing institutions in Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like Robert Brenner and Guy Bois took issue with this explanation (and each other), arguing that Postan and Le Roy Ladurie (and North and Thomas by extension) were ignoring the issue of class in explaining changes in relative wages and the institutions governing labor. Glossing this “Brenner Debate” is well beyond the scope of this post, so suffice it to say that Brenner and Bois argue that changes in population are not sufficient to change institutions. The effect of population changes on labor conditions depended on the actual political power of peasants, which was not necessarily affected by population. See the compilation &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lp39Zh&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all you’d ever want to know about this debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the details of that argument, and it is a fascinating read, Brenner and Bois use the term Malthusian to describe their opponents and their theories. And to me, this is an incorrect use of Malthusian. The concept that population size influences wages is not Malthusian, it is economics-ian. There is nothing Malthusian about Postan, Le Roy Ladurie, and North and Thomas, at least when it comes to their explanation of institutional change. This doesn’t make Brenner and Bois wrong. It makes them semantically confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limits-to-growth&quot;&gt;Limits to Growth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third way I think Malthusian gets used is in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2kIQ269&quot;&gt;limits to growth&lt;/a&gt;, environmental collapse, and the like. Here, the authors or speakers believe firmly that there is a fixed supply of resources available, and hence living standards must be negatively related to population size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can class the limits to growth people into two groups. The first takes population growth as given, and doesn’t think much about whether it responds to living standards. The fact that population growth is positive - at the global level - is sufficient to create declining living standards, and thus we need to either conserve resources or exert some kind of birth control policy. The second group has internalized the post-demographic transition &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; relationship of living standards and population growth. Once the planet gets so crowded that living standards fall, this will &lt;em&gt;raise&lt;/em&gt; the population growth rate, and we’ll be in a death spiral towards misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view, of either group, is often called Malthusian because of the negative effect of population on living standards. And that, it seems, is only about half right. There is no stagnation in the sense that I described above, as in either case population growth continues (slowly or in an accelerating manner) until the living standard is zero. Which I guess would be stagnant, if it stayed at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I don’t consider myself a Malthusian in this sense of the word, and that is because the finite limit of resources gets progressively looser over time. This post is already stretched out too long, so I don’t want to get into a lot of detail here. But there are two reasons for this. First, because technological change will make some resource constraints less binding or eliminate the need for certain resources. Second, because the income elasticity of demand for resource-intense goods is low, our use of those resources will not grow as fast as limits to growth types would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that my original description of Malthusian economies ignores this second effect, coming through income elasticities. Ashraf and Galor’s model, for example, would suggest that no matter how high productivity got, we are always producing goods using the same resource-intense production function. That may be fine if you are just describing the stagnant economies prior to sustained growth - or maybe it isn’t fine, if you read Lemin Wu’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://behl.berkeley.edu/files/2015/02/WP2015-01_Wu.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; - but breaks down if you allow for any appreciable non-resource based sector (e.g. services of any kind).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yes, ideas are harder to find. Don&#39;t panic yet.</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Idea-TFP/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Idea-TFP/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nick Bloom, Chad Jones, John van Reenen, and Michael Webb have a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on how productive we are at producing “ideas”, which one can argue are the ultimate source of all economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The splash graphic from the paper, which I believe made a brief tour of the Twitter-verse a month or so ago, is shown below. It shows that the TFP growth rate (in blue) peaked around the 1940’s, and has declined since then. The axis measurement here is a big funky, as you could see more of the details of this line if they had made the left axis go up to say 5%, rather than 25%. Regardless, the TFP growth rate is smaller than it was in the past, following Robert Gordon’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In green is the relative number of researchers compared to the number in 1930. This isn’t the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of researchers, its a measure of &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; researchers, found by dividing total R and D spending by the nominal wage of high-skilled workers. Relative to 1930, we have almost 25 times as many (effective) researchers at work today. This leads to the author’s title question - “Are ideas getting harder to find?”. And the author’s answer is “Yes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jones_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Idea TFP and TFP Growth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-idea-tfp&quot;&gt;Measuring Idea TFP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJvRW measure how “hard” it is to find ideas by looking at what they call “idea TFP”. This is easy to back out from some data. Let’s write the growth rate of ideas (I) as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\dot{I}_t}{I_t} = \alpha_t S_t&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where the left side is the growth rate of ideas at time t, and on the right-hand side we’ve got the determinants of that growth. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_t\inline&quot;/&gt; is research effort, and here think of the measure of effective researchers. How much work do we put into coming up with new ideas? The second term is &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha_t\inline&quot;/&gt;, which is the “idea TFP”. It tells you how much idea growth you get out of those researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tell me the growth rate of ideas (the left) and the number of effective researchers (S), then I (well, the authors) can back out the measure of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha_t\inline&quot;/&gt; year by year. And this is what BJvRW do, in a variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they do first is to equate the growth rate of ideas with the growth rate of TFP (actual aggregate TFP in producing GDP). That doesn’t mean that each idea is equal to one “unit” of TFP, it just means that if the number of ideas grows by 10%, then TFP grows by 10%. This is a big leap - but let’s not get hung up on this. It isn’t important in this first context. With the data from the first graph on the TFP growth rate (&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dot{I}/I\inline&quot;/&gt;), and the number of effective researchers (&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_t\inline&quot;/&gt;), we can back out &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha_t\inline&quot;/&gt;. This “idea TFP” is, awkwardly, the “TFP TFP”, or our productivity at producing TFP given a set of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jones_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Idea TFP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second graph plots the &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha_t\inline&quot;/&gt; they back out, relative to 1930. You can see that it falls to about 1/64th of the level in 1930. Because we are 1/64th as effective at turning researchers into TFP, but we only have 32 times as many researchers, our growth rate of TFP is about 1/2 as high as it was in the 1930’s/1940’s. Hang on to the “why” question for a moment. For now, we’re just looking at the pure accounting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first exercise using (actual) TFP as the measure of ideas is a bit crude, and what BJvRW go on to do is examine individual industries or types of products to establish that the “idea TFP” is in fact falling within each of these as well. This is relevant because the first result using TFP does not tell us what is happening at the “micro” level. We could have constant (or even rising) “idea TFP” within individual industries or lines of research, and yet in aggregate falling “idea TFP”. It may be that ideas are not perfectly translated to TFP, or it may be that the we are spreading our research efforts over an ever-expanding list of industries or lines of research. In the latter case, idea growth in individual industries/lines may be falling because of the decline in numbers of researchers, not because of declining idea TFP. But in aggregate, this would look like declining idea TFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus looking at individual industries/lines will help us sort out what is happening. The first example is transistors, and the count of transistors per square inch on a chip. Famously, this appears to obey Moore’s Law, which is that the number of transistors per square inch doubles every 18 months. If we count the number of transistors per square inch as “ideas”, then this translates to a growth rate of 35% per year. At the same time, the effective number of researchers working at chip companies (Intel, AMD, etc..) has grown by a factor of about 80 since 1970. Plotting this together yields their next figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jones_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moores Law&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to the first graph, there is no decline in the growth rate of transistors. But there also isn’t an increase, despite the increased number of researchers. What this means is that “transistor idea TFP” is falling over time, at about 10% per year. As they point out in the paper, Moore’s Law still holds, but it takes 78 times more researchers to figure out how to double transistor density than it did in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the paper works through several other examples. I’ll leave it to you to look at the specifics. But overall, the message becomes clear. For crop yields, idea TFP is falling at between 3% and 9% per year, except for cotton, where it rose slightly over time. For “new molecular entities” (e.g. drugs) idea TFP has fallen to about 1/4 of its value in 1970, or about 3% per year. BJvRW also look at firm size, measured in different ways, which should be related to their productivity (and ideas). In each case, their size is not growing as fast as their RD spending, implying their idea TFP is falling at about 8-15% per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-economic-growth&quot;&gt;Implications for Economic Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looming question here is whether this implies economic growth is due to slow down to zero. And the answer is “No”. It is possible for ideas to have a constant growth rate (and GDP per capita to have a constant growth rate as well) even if idea TFP is falling over time. For “semi-endogenous growth theory”, a term often associated with Chad Jones, this falling idea TFP is consistent with constant, positive growth in GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what is in the Jones/Vollrath &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2k0pcbz&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; (buy 1, buy 10, buy 1000!) when we teach how ideas accumulate. Modify that first equation I showed you to look like the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\dot{I}_t}{I_t} = \frac{\alpha}{I_t^{\beta}} S_t.&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where idea TFP is now the ratio of a constant, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha\inline&quot;/&gt;, and the number of ideas, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_t\inline&quot;/&gt;, raised to the power &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. The value of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is quite important. If &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta=0\inline&quot;/&gt;, then the level of ideas has no effect on idea TFP, and idea TFP should be constant. This is what was in the original Romer model, by the way. What Jones did was to say that this implies a very knife-edge condition, and there was no reason to assume that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta=0\inline&quot;/&gt;. When &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta&amp;gt;0\inline&quot;/&gt;, as we accumulate more ideas, the growth rate of ideas falls - idea TFP goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just because idea TFP falls as we get more ideas doesn’t mean the &lt;em&gt;growth rate&lt;/em&gt; of ideas (the left hand side) is falling. Why? Because &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_t\inline&quot;/&gt; is rising over time due to population growth. If the share of people working as researchers is constant, then their absolute number is rising over time. In that case, there is a growth rate of ideas such that the growth rate of ideas stays constant over time, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dot{I}/I = n/\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;, where &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n\inline&quot;/&gt; is the growth rate of population (and hence of researchers). Idea growth need not slow down just because idea TFP falls over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the “don’t panic yet” comment in the title. Falling idea TFP may well be the natural course of things, without resulting in lower actual TFP growth. The observed fall in actual TFP growth would have to come from some other forces involved in generating research effort. Start with an explanation that might imply a permanent fall in the TFP growth rate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The growth rate of the effective population has fallen&lt;/strong&gt;. If the population that provides researchers (and it is best here to think of the total population of advanced countries, not just the US) starts to grow more slowly, then S grows more slowly, and the long-run growth rate of ideas is going to be lower. Maybe the slowdown in TFP growth is due to slower population growth in developed countries. A counterargument would be that this is offset by the increasing shares of Chinese and Indian populations that are in the pool of possible researchers. A counter-counterargument would be that age distributions matter too, and we’ve got too many stodgy old people, and not enough inventive young whipper-snappers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other explanations might imply that the drop in the TFP growth rate will be temporary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A downward shift in the share of that population that is doing research&lt;/strong&gt;. This would generate a lower measured short-run growth rate of ideas because S would have a lower short-run growth rate for a while as we moved to a lower share of people doing research. This doesn’t appear to be true in the data, where an increasing share of workers are reported as doing RD work over time - and that should be pushing &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; the short-run growth rate of ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An exogenous drop in the level of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha\inline&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, the growth rate of ideas would eventually rise back up to what it was before, after we had lower measured TFP growth for a while on our way to a new equilibrium. If we’re going to argue about the value of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha\inline&quot;/&gt;, though, then we should start over with our theory about how ideas get generated, as saying “it was a random exogenous shock” ends up being kind of useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, maybe semi-endogenous growth theory is wrong. Maybe this just isn’t the way to look at things. Alternative theories might say idea growth could be affected by policies (subsidies for basic research, tax policy regarding treatment of RD spending, etc..) and what we’ve seen is a continuous deterioration of the policies supporting idea generation. This one is a little hard to square, though, just because it seems odd that there would be such growth in the number of researchers if the returns to that research at the firm or individual level were going down so much. I can see how taxes on RD would lower the resources devoted to it, but why would that affect how effective RD efforts are? You’d have to argue that policies were incenting companies to work on useless ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The returns to societal capital</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Society-Dividend/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Society-Dividend/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Brad DeLong had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/regional-policy-and-distributional-policy-in-a-world-where-people-want-to-ignore-the-value-and-contribution-of-knowledge-and-network-based-increasing-returns/&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; that contained a number of ideas regarding how we view redistribution in a market economy. I picked up on some comments he made towards the end of that post, in which he points out that much of our prosperity comes from a stock of societal capital that we unknowingly rely on every day. And because that societal capital is unseen and uncompensated, we are all in some way overpaid for what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he says societal capital, I think of it in two broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this is much of what DeLong has in mind. We are lucky to be in the “trust” or “cooperate” equilibrium in our repeated game of exhanging goods and services. If you like, call it the “stag hunt” equilibrium &lt;a href=&quot;http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2016/12/staghunt-and-the-irs.html&quot;&gt;Nick Rowe&lt;/a&gt; talks about. Regardless, we benefit from the decisions of our ancestors to play this equilibrium, so that it is the default. If you want to say this is due to some institutions, or culture, or pure luck, it doesn’t matter. We’ve found our way to the trust equilibrium, and benfit from that immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: He doesn’t mention this explicitly, but I think it is as relevant as trust. Scale influences the potential profits from innovations, and so is crucial to growth. Bigger market, more profits, more incentives to innovate. But scale is not the same thing as trust, or institutions, or culture. If you doubt that, ask yourself why no firm is spending millions to get into New Zealand, paragon of free market institutions, but they are falling all over themselves to do business in China. Living in the US, or EU, or China, is to reap the benefits of living with scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of DeLong’s point is that neither trust nor scale are things that are owned by any firm or individual. You could say that we inherited them from our ancestors, or you could say these are emergent properties, or you could say that they are designed by the institutions we choose for ourselves. Regardless, trust and scale are “ideas” in the broadest sense, and are inputs into the production process in that trust and scale mean our set of rival inputs (labor, capital) can produce more with them than without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it that scale and trust mean we are overpaid? Here I’ll borrow an idea from DeLong, and “hoist one from the archives” of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/what-assumptions-matter-for-growth-theory/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just to refresh, a production function tells us that output is determined by some combination of non-rival inputs and rival inputs. Non-rival inputs are things like ideas that can be used by many firms or people at once without limiting the use by others. Think of blueprints. Rival inputs are things that can only be used by one person or firm at a time. Think of nails. The income earned by both rival and non-rival inputs has to add up to total output. Okay, given all that setup, here are three statements that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Output is constant returns to scale in &lt;em&gt;rival&lt;/em&gt; inputs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Non-rival inputs receive some portion of output&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rival inputs receive output equal to their marginal product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pick two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideas of trust and scale are non-rival inputs to production. If we assume that output is constant returns to scale in rival inputs (point 1), then we have to pick wither 2 or 3. As neither trust nor scale receive payments, we have essentially chosen 3. And in that sense DeLong means that rival inputs (our labor and our capital) are overpaid. We are not compensating anyone for the trust and scale that we inherited or created as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first aside is that in my set-up choosing 3 implies that rival inputs earn their marginal products, and DeLong is saying that our labor is earning &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than its marginal product. I don’t think this is actually a meaningful difference. DeLong is saying that labor is overpaid because it earns returns that could be going to ideas like trust and scale. Whether we say that what it earns is the marginal product or not is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second aside is that it isn’t really as stark as saying we chose option 3. Some ideas - the patent for an iPhone, the trademark on Coca-Cola - are protected and receive compensation. All I’m saying here is that scale and trust are ideas that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; receiving compensation, and in that sense rival inputs like labor are overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third aside is you may be wondering how the increasing returns to scale that DeLong mentions fits in here. Note that point 1 only says production is constant returns to scale in rival inputs (labor and capital). In terms of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; inputs (labor, capital, and ideas) production is increasing returns to scale. If I doubled all of them, output would more than double.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the main story. What DeLong does with this is to provide what I found to be a unique justification for the public sector. That is, taxes are a way of collecting the royalties on trust and scale that we inherited and/or create ourselves. Taxes are the rents to idea of playing “cooperate” or having scale. And the proper use of those rents, if I am reading him correctly, is in ensuring that those endowments are perpetuated and handed off to our own children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to perpetuate trust and scale? Part of it, I think, is in providing the insurance against the fluctuations that are the necessary corrollary of the markets we create with trust and scale. Those fluctuations play havoc with local communities and ways of life, a la Polyani. Hence individuals or communities may be tempted to defect from the cooperate/trust equilibria, or hive themselves off on their own and reduce the scale of the economy. If we spend the rents of trust and scale supporting those communities, we can incent them to stay in the good equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with this, as DeLong spends most of his post working out, is that simply handing out those rents to people creates issues for everyone involved. Those paying taxes feel that they are being taken as suckers. Those receiving the rents - the members of disrupted communities - feel like deadbeats. No one wants to be in either of those positions. We have built-in preferences that make deviation from trust and scale look attractive. Which is why being in the good equilibrium is such a delicate thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then, do you justify the collection of the rents that, arguably, rightfully belong to all of us, and ensure that we pass on the trust and scale necessary for prosperity to the next generation? And do so in a way that is palatable to all parties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea is that you can use the idea of rents or royalties as a positive justifcation of taxation. We are collecting on the royalties due to us as a citizenry for our trust and scale, the same way that Apple collects royalties due to them as a designer of useful touchscreen emoji delivery machines. In this concept, taxation is not theft, or a necessary evil, but rather the enforcement of our intellectual property rights over trust and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end, the distribution of those rents is perhaps more palatable when seen not as a handout (which makes people feel like a deadbeat) but as something like a dividend on shared ownership of an asset. I feel like this would be one way to think of how a universal basic income could be framed - everyone is getting their share of the collective dividend payment due to the owners of the “ideas” of trust and scale. It is a sign of ownership, not dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can you do historical counter-factuals?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: rank speculation lies ahead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I fell hopelessly behind in an on-going Twitter-storm surrounding history and economics, and how the two fields think of causality and counterfactuals. The culprits filling up my notifications page included &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pseudoerasmus&quot;&gt;Pseudoerasmus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leah_boustan&quot;&gt;Leah Platt Boustan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RichardALJones&quot;&gt;Richard Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinhorourke&quot;&gt;Kevin O’Rourke&lt;/a&gt;. This is my uber-Tweet response, and I’m going to leave the 140 character limit in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of the Twittering was an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Marc Parry that on a battle between economists and historians. He speaks with historian Eric Foner, and says “Foner considers counterfactuals absurd. A historian’s job is not to speculate about alternative universes, he says. It’s to figure out what happened and why.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, the context of the article is about the debate between economists and historians on the role of slavery in supporting capitalism, with (some) historians implying capitalism was impossible without slavery and (some) economists responding that capitalism would have proceeded just fine without it. You can see a little summary in the Economist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/12/pain-past&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What appeared to get people going on Twitter was the idea that Foner “considers counterfactuals absurd”. The response to this is best summarized by the immortal Inigo Montoya: “I do not think that word means what you think it means.” The criticism is that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; historians do counterfactuals when they suggest that factor X (e.g. slavery) caused Y (e.g. capitalism). By saying X caused Y, you are saying that if X failed to exist/happen - which would be counter to the facts of history - Y would not have existing/happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are the economists (many of them) so comfortable with, and happy to think about, counterfactuals? And why are historians (some of them) not happy with the concept? My proposal here is that the economists approach these questions from the perspective of a standard empirical setting with lots of observations, and they extend that to thinking about history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a big cross-sectional dataset on individuals, let’s say with information on wages, education, and the like. It also has a dummy variable for gender: 0 for males, 1 for females. You could run a regression of (log) wages on years of education, age, lots of other control variables, and the gender dummy variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economist trained in empirics will look at this and say that the gender dummy variable indicates the counter-factual effect of gender on wages. That is, if you could take a man, and counter-factually make them a woman while holding everything else about them the same, how much would their wage fall? Or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is of course ridiculous as an actual policy change. You cannot simply flip someone’s gender, and even if you could, the other variables related to this person would likely change as well. If you could go back and change the gender of a person at birth, they would have almost certainly have had different education experiences, different job experiences, different health outcomes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with a large cross-sectional dataset, we could page through the data and find a woman with the same, or very similar characteristics, to the man we started looking at. And then we could just compare the man to the woman with similar characteristics, and look at their wage difference. That is plausible in an intuitive way. And when economists think of doing a counter-factual, this plausible comparison is what they often have in mind. Or at least, this is what empirical training has embedded in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we take that kind of counter-factual to historical studies, where the plausible intuitive way doesn’t make sense. Studying slavery and capitalism, for example, we do not have thousands of different societies or cultures to page through to find one that looks &lt;em&gt;almost exactly&lt;/em&gt; like the Anglo-American industrializing societies, but doesn’t have slavery. We cannot compare like to like, and do the plausible counter-factual comparison like we did with gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only have the more dramatic counter-factual. What if we took the observed Anglo-American industrializing societies and somehow “switched off” slavery, just like taking the man in the wage data and “switching” his gender to female. The experience and implications of slavery are entwined with every other aspect of the industrializing societies, and pulling it out would entail massive shocks to all these other aspects. “Doing the counterfactual” looks like a big mess, and perhaps this is what Foner is objecting to because it sounds like writing some sort of alternative history novel. And it would be pure speculation to write such a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would, but this is a second point at which concepts drawn from large dataset empirics make economists more comfortable with counter-factuals. We don’t have to think about writing down an alternative history novel. We need to think about lots and lots of possible novels in which slavery did not exist, and lots and lots in which it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And based on those thousands of alternative history novels, is it true that when slavery remains present into the 1800’s, that capitalism develops? And is it true that when slavery fails to persist (or maybe never really exists?) that capitalism fails to develop? We wouldn’t even have to be strict about the relationship between one and the other, we could ask if - statistically speaking - alternative histories without slavery tended to be without capitalism, and alternative histories with slavery tended to have capitalism. When economists are talking about historical counterfactuals, I think this is what they have in mind. At least, it is what I have in mind to make sense of claims like “slavery was necessary for capitalism”, or any claim that “X was necessary for Y”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim that slavery was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessary for capitalism is not meant to be an iron-clad statement of truth. At least I hope that those who make the claim do not mean it this way, because that would be wrong. What it does mean is that of all the alternative histories we could have gotten, the ones without slavery most likely would still have gotten capitalism anyway. And the proposed explanations for that - Indian and Egyptian supply responses, alternative labor arrangements in the US South - are arguments about the probability of capitalism occurring in those thousands of alternative histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see why this can be frustrating to those coming at this from the history side of things. This seems to reduce historical work, which is in part the patient documentation of the particular, to a sideline. How could you possibly conceive of thousands of different alternative histories, when we as yet know so little about this one? The economist’s approach appears dismissive. Much the same way that telling someone who failed to find a good job after college, and is getting by working part-time at Pizza Hut, that their wages are approximately 50% higher in expectation because of their degree. Guess your particular error term draw just sucked. ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, one advantage of thinking explicitly about this in terms of many-alternative-histories is that you can avoid falling into arguements about mono-causality. If you say that slavery is necessary for capitalism, and then say that in a counterfactual history without slavery capitalism would not have existed, you a careening perilously close to saying that slavery was the &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; cause of capitalism. You might try to swerve to avoid this by saying that speculating about that counterfactuals is silly in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you think about many alternative histories, it is much easier to avoid making mono-causal statements. Saying, “If we compared histories with slavery and without slavery, I believe that a statistically significant difference would exist between them in the appearance of capitalism” is wishy-washy, poor writing, and not exactly attention-getting. But it is clear that slavery is not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; possible cause of capitalism, because you are allowing for the idea that some non-slave histories could have found their way to capitalism anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot get my head around asking “why”, as Foner does, without being able to undertake any kind of counter-factual exercise, whether in the data or in my head. But perhaps the concept of thinking in terms of many-alternative-histories, rather than feeling you must commit to a single one, is a way of making the idea of counterfactuals more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick post to vent some of the pressure from my reading list before it explodes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greg Ip has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-economys-hidden-problem-were-out-of-big-ideas-1481042066&quot;&gt;extensive piece&lt;/a&gt; in the WSJ on being “out of big ideas”. One quality of this article is that it gives some plausible ideas for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the pace of innovation may have slowed down in some areas. We may be plowing resources into things like medical research that have apparently small returns in terms of years of life saved. But, given our relative wealth, this may be entirely optimal. Adding a week to a cancer victims life may be worth more than inventing a better dishwasher. One quibble. Ip states early on that despite historically high number of scientists and engineers, “None of this has translated into meaningful advances in Americans’ standard of living.” We don’t know that. It may not appear to have generated advances in the growth rate of GDP per capita, GDP per capita need not be the same thing as meaningful advances in standards of living.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of Twitter (yes, they exist) is following very smart people as they argue a point. I fell behind during an on-going discussion of Robert Allen’s concept of a “high-wage economy” in England driving the adoption of machines leading to the industrial revolution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://notesonliberty.com/2016/12/07/the-high-wage-economy-hypothesis/&quot;&gt;Vincent Geloso&lt;/a&gt; did the Lord’s work in providing a fair summary of Allen’s position and some of the associated Twitter-commentary, and then catches you up on the possible holes in Allen’s argument. As a place to start reading about Allen’s hypothesis, this is quite nice, and provides many links to research questioning the assumptions behind Allen’s ideas. Then follow it up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pseudoerasmus.com/2016/12/01/allen/&quot;&gt;Pseudoerasmus’&lt;/a&gt; post on the same subject, and with a similar, honest, approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIT is starting a “micro-masters” &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/mitx-micromasters-program-development-economics-masters-degree-1205&quot;&gt;program in development&lt;/a&gt;. Low-cost enrollment on-line for students in developing countries, with the possibility for exceptional students being offered physical positions at MIT. As a means of expanding the availability of education, this is great. As a way of tightening the net that excellent students may slip through, it is even better. I do admissions for the PhD program at UH, and I am sure that I have let slip students who would be incredible economists. But their applications just cannot show that. Giving students a low-cost way of signalling their quality ahead of time is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Piketty, Saez, Zucman machine rolls on, with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/economic-growth-in-the-united-states-a-tale-of-two-countries/&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; trying to reconcile national income accounts (GDP, etc..) with individual wealth/income distribution data. If you are reading this blog, you likely already have perused the paper or summaries based on it. It’s stark in how the fortunes of various percentiles of the income distribution have fared over time. What I also would like to applaud these authors for is writing papers that are about simple accounting. This the kind of economic research that you could explain to your neighbor in about 20 minutes, and that should be seen as a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://voxeu.org/article/production-fragmentation-and-global-trade-slowdown&quot;&gt;Timmer, Los, Stehrer, De Vries&lt;/a&gt; have a nice post of their current research regarding the change in trade over the last 15 years. In short, if I’m getting this right, the surge in trade from 2000-2008 was in large part due to the increasing fragmentation of production in goods - lots of parts coming from lots of different countries - and then this trend stopped after the crisis in 2008. Trade growth is slowing down because production is not increasing the number of sources for parts any more, to again over-simplify. Some of this slowdown in fragmenting of production appears due to demand effects, as countries (incl. China) shift demand towards goods (or services) that use fewer differentiated parts as inputs. Baumol strikes again?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Useless, but fun. Selected &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/crazy.html&quot;&gt;stupid patents&lt;/a&gt; that have actually been granted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://voxeu.org/article/piketty-s-housing-capital-results-new-us-facts&quot;&gt;piece of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that much of the increase in capital’s share of income over time is due to housing. Gianni La Cava narrows it down further to an increase in the share of income going to owner-occupied housing. Now, this income is imputed from the value of housing, so La Cava is finding that the run-up in the value of the housing stock is creating a noticeable shift in the distribution of income towards capital. Here’s a good question, then, which I may try to tackle at some point. What is the capital/labor split of income &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; housing - or any other imputed value - included? Is the labor share shrinking as well?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d#.6kz8o2jlp&quot;&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; of various reporting on the possibility that machines will steal all the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Would you pay to save a job?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Trade/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Trade/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Konczal has a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rortybomb/learning-from-trump-in-retrospect-dce431b23ed0#.70zws6ugy&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about how important it is to distinguish “jobs” from “the economy”, and how Trump used that to his advantage. Noah Smith had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-02/a-job-is-more-than-a-paycheck&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of the idea that a job is “more than a paycheck”. In my head, this is a complement to the arguments that Dani Rodrik has been making for years, as in his 1997 book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2gzJqH4&quot;&gt;Has Globalization Gone too Far?&lt;/a&gt;. In economist terms, the easiest way to say this is that having a job actually enters the utility function separately from the real wage it generates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one idea to add to this, which is that even the “winners” of trade (or technological shocks) are unhappy about other people losing their jobs. If you like, the job status of others has an effect on the utility function of those &lt;em&gt;with jobs&lt;/em&gt;. And it means they are willing to trade off some other source of utility (real wages) in order to give those people jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m not sure I’m explaining this terribly well, let me give you an example of a choice I posed to a number of “regular people” in my neighborhood, and during the after-game-beer-drinking phase of my hockey league. I’ve been doing this for a year or two, but recent events have made the responses more salient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not claiming that I had some sort of insight a few years ago. This all started because of a random conversation with Kenny, one of the guys in my hockey league, which led to him saying that he’d “absolutely” pay $100 more for a TV if it meant more American workers didn’t have to go on welfare. After that, I started posing the same kind of question to others in an ad hoc manner. I realize that this all has a very David Brooks-ish bullshit man-on-the-street vibe. Feel free to discount accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of the choice I posed to people regarding a hypothetical trade deal (I typically didn’t use such precise numbers, but this gives you a concrete idea of what I was asking):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option A&lt;/strong&gt;. With the trade deal, let’s say that the income of a winner - people who stay employed - is 1000. The price index with trade is 0.8. Let’s say there are four winners for every loser - the ones who lose jobs - but we organize a redistribution of the gains from trade to make sure the losers are compensated. We tax every winner 200, and use that to give every loser 800. The winners, after their tax of 200, are also making 800. With an price index of 0.8, every person - winners and losers - has a real wage of 800/0.8 = 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option B&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t do the trade deal. Everyone is still employed, but their income is 700, which is lower than what a winner makes under the trade deal, and means that in aggregate, total income is lower than with the trade deal. Also, the price index is higher without trade, because we don’t get cheap imports. So let the price index be 1, and every person has a real wage of 700/1 = 700.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which option would you choose? The pure economist answer is A, because obviously everyone is better off in terms of real consumption, with a real wage of 1000 versus 700. Noah’s post was about how job losers would probably prefer B. Most people would rather take the lower real wage of 700 with an actual job, versus a transfer with a real value of 1000. If you want to call this a form of money illusion, fine, but that doesn’t make it wrong. It is easy to say that their utility function puts more weight on income that is received from working versus income received as a hand out. It is not a stretch to get your head around this. I have spent years trying to instill this &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; preference set into my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was more interesting in posing this question to various people I knew was the response of “winners”. Most of the time, I told people that they should imagine that they would be a “winner” under the deal. And for the most part, the people I was talking to were already winners with respect to trade, or were professionals relatively immune from the effects (e.g. doctors or lawyers). Regardless, &lt;em&gt;even winners preferred B&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would potential winners prefer B? Anecdotally, they don’t like the idea of having to hand over some of their own wages to subsidize people who are &lt;em&gt;not working&lt;/em&gt;. They know these people lost their jobs due to the trade deal or technological change, and a number of people I spoke with said they would be in favor of some kind of subsidy for the losers, but only for a very limited time. But it doesn’t seem fair to them that the job losers don’t have to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, even if it wasn’t the job losers fault in the first place. People care about the job status of others. This is, I would venture, some of the reason that individuals care about their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; job status in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical winners also tend to express a sort of endowment effect. Once you pay them 1000, it is much more tangible to them that they are giving up some of “their” money to subsidize job losers. On the other hand, under plan B they pay the subsidy implicitly through higher prices and lower nominal wages, and there is no endowment effect for them. And the people I asked this question are completely aware, like Kenny, of the fact that they are paying a subsidy through higher prices. The winners are for redistribution, but they care a lot about how that redistibution takes place. Again, this sounds like money illusion, but that doesn’t make it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the answers I got are in line with what Konczal, Smith, and Rodrik (and others) have said before about the value of jobs versus GDP. I’d suggest that even those with secure employment have preferences that would lead them to support jobs &lt;em&gt;for others&lt;/em&gt; at the cost of some GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we should scrap every trade deal? No. The implication of my little study is that people are willing to trade off &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the gains from trade to keep more people employed. That doesn’t mean they are willing to trade off &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the gains from trade. If Option B were to scrap all trade deals and lower the real wage of everyone to 200, rather than 700, you would probably get a different answer from both potential winners and losers. And given the embedded nature of imports in supply chains, you could well make the case that the losses would be astronomical, and thus not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other policies relating to job creation would face the same questions. Noah brought up the idea of incentives for long-term contracts, and noted the worry that you can take this too far. If you incentivize long-term contracts, do you gum up the labor market so much that new firms cannot afford to get stated or grow, and old ones cannot afford to shut down? Or do you end up getting the same issues we have now with trade; a class of “winners” that get long-term contracts and a class of “losers” that do not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of doing economics, I’m not sold that building the concept of this job preference into models would amount to much more than slapping some math around. I think our job is a little more humble. Be really clear about the economic costs and benefits of Options A and B on things like real wages and GDP that we have some hope of actually quantifying, and then let people decide if they are willing to pay those costs to save jobs or not.&lt;/p&gt;
