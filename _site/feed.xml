        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I wait to hear if and when UH will close campus because of the coronavirus I figured it would be a more productive use of my time to type than to update websites reporting case numbers. This post has absolutely nothing to do with the virus, so if you’re looking for something to either take your mind of of it, or at least put you to sleep, then here you go. At some point I’d like to do something about the economic impact of the virus, specifically using it to think about I/O networks and such, but I haven’t figured out a good way to work through that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was on my mind instead was markups, market power, and productivity, which has been on ongoing topic here. I did a few posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;accounting&lt;/em&gt; for the effect of markups on productivity and GDP. One of the points of those was that given an increase in average markups, there may be a counter-intuitive &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in measured productivity and GDP at the same time. If inputs are shifted from low-markup to high-markup products, this implicitly is raising the value of what we produce from the consumers perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those posts took the increase in average markups as a given, however, and didn’t consider why that increase took place. Nor did it consider the dynamic consequences of that increase in markups, which might involve firms changing their decisions about how much to invest in innovation based on those markups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my grad growth course recently we went through two papers by Ufuk Akcigit and Sina Ates (AA), which focus on the reason for why markups may have gone up, but also allow one to model the dynamic consequences of those markup changes. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/25755.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; paper provides a simpler model to get your head around, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/red/sed019/150.html&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; gives you all the bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic story from AA is that many of the facts regarding the decline in business dynamism observed over the last 20-30 years, including the rise in markups, can be understood as a consequence of a decline in the rate of knowledge diffusion across firms. With less diffusion of knowledge, the gap in productivity between industry leaders and followers grew, which allowed for higher markups to be charged by the leaders, which in turn explains why profits rose and wages fell as a share of GDP. They also attribute the fall in firm entry rates to the decline in knowledge diffusion, as it became harder for outsiders to jump into industries. Ultimately they tie this decline in knowledge diffusion to an increase in intellectual property rights protections. Their model tells them knowledge diffusion was more important (in quantitative terms) than things like lower corporate taxes, R&amp;amp;D subsidies, or entry costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you find reasons to be skeptical of their explanation, the paper provides a way of thinking about how market power and markups interact with investments in R&amp;amp;D to jointly determine the aggregate growth rate. It’s an application of the kind of Schumpeterian growth models that Akcigit is known for, building on the body of work associated mainly with &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/zheli/A3.pdf&quot;&gt;Aghion and Howitt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facts-on-markups-and-dynamism&quot;&gt;Facts on markups and dynamism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the model and the explanation based on knowledge diffusion, let’s recap some of the facts that AA are building their model to explain. I’m going to focus on 7 here, while AA present 10 different facts, mainly just to save space and time. I did not cut and paste in all of their figures documenting these facts, and just included a few notes on each. If you’re reading this blog, my guess is that you are familiar with most of these already, and can see AA’s first paper for the specific cites and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market concentration rose. The share of sales accounted for by the top 4 firms across industries rose from about 38% in 1980 to 44% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average markups rose. Various sources document average markups rising from around 1980 to 2010, but be aware that there are questions about whether this rise in markups is due to measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profit share of GDP rose. This is consistent with higher markups on average, and you get an increase from around 2% of GDP in 1980 to around 14% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The labor share of GDP went down. Consistent with the rise in profit share, from about 68% in 1980 to 60% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The productivity gap rose. This one may not be as familiar. Roughly, the most productive firms have seen their productivity rise by about 30% from 2002 to 2011, while other firms saw their productivity rise by only about 10% in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firm entry rate fell. Familiar to those of you interested in business dynamism. The entry rate was about 12% in 1980, and only about 8% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The share of young firms fell. Young (less than 5 year old) firms employed about 18% of workers in 1980, but only about 8% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-markups-come-from&quot;&gt;Where do markups come from?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What AA want to do is provide a unified explanation for all seven of these facts (actually, all ten facts in their paper) without taking any of them as a given. Everything flows from the basics of how firms compete and set markups. Start by thinking about a single product (e.g. USB chargers, or dishwashers, or payroll processing services). For that product, imagine there are two firms who can produce it. Those two firms are in Bertrand competition with one another. They each choose the price they will charge, and then let the customers sort out how much to buy from each firm. The firms are aware they are in competition with the other, and so set prices strategically to maximize profits, knowing how the other firm will respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other settings this can lead to all sorts of interesting behavior, but for AA things work out in a pretty straightforward manner because firms can have different marginal costs. If firm A has a marginal cost of 2, and firm B has a marginal cost of 3, then if firm A charges anything less than 3, firm B cannot match the price because it will incur a loss. So firm A will charge anything less than 3 and get &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the customers. Firm A wants to maximize profits, so it will charge 2.999999, take all the business, and hence charge a &lt;em&gt;markup&lt;/em&gt; of approximately 3/2 = 1.5. More generally, the markup charged by a firm selling any given product is equal to the ratio of the marginal cost of the &lt;em&gt;trailing&lt;/em&gt; firm (e.g. 3) to the marginal cost of the &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; firm (e.g. 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firm A thus earns profits. As with any model involving markups, those profits depend on the total expenditures on the product they sell (so market size matters) and the markup itself. For the example in the prior paragraph, Firm A will take 33% of the total expenditures on their product as profits, and the other 67% will be used to cover costs. They charge 3 per unit, and each unit costs 2 to produce, so the remaining 1 is taken as profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if the two firms had identical marginal costs then AA assume they split the sales to customers, with each charging a price equal to marginal cost, and earning zero profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next question. Why is one firm leading (i.e. has lower marginal costs), and why is one following (i.e. has higher marginal costs)? This comes about because of an endogenous decision of each firm to invest in R&amp;amp;D that lowers their marginal cost. This is where AA take us from a simple accounting exercise and move into the actual economics behind the dynamics of markups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a firm invests in R&amp;amp;D, they increase the probability that they will discover a way to lower their marginal cost. To make things more coherent AA assume these declines are almost always the same proportion (e.g. each discovery lowers marginal cost by 25%). But, and this will be important for their ultimate story, there is also a chance that you get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; lucky and your marginal cost drops all the way to the marginal cost of the leading firm. This isn’t an analogy they use, but I think of their R&amp;amp;D process as one of hiring engineers. You hire engineers from the labor force at random, and any engineer has a chance of figuring out a piecemeal way of lowering your costs. But sometimes you happen to hire an engineer who used to work at the leading firm, and she is able to spill the beans on some major cost savings. This lucky break is what AA mean by “knowledge diffusion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probabilistic nature of R&amp;amp;D explains why even the following firm - which recall makes zero sales in the model - is willing to take losses and hang in there to invest in R&amp;amp;D. They &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to make enough piecemeal improvements, or get lucky enough in hiring the right engineer, to match or beat the leading firm in terms of marginal cost. If they do they become the leading firm and earn all the profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use a similar logic to think about why a outsider &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; firm (C) might be started by an entrepreneur who pushes the follower aside and starts competing with the leading firm. You could imagine that this is an engineer from firm B who is fed up with management and figures they can do a better job at lowering costs if they run their own firm. Again, this is what AA refer to as knowledge diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I’m reading a book right now on the early history of Silicon Valley, and I can’t help but frame it in terms of this model. The Fairchild Semiconductor guys are the fed-up engineers who separate from Shockley Semiconductors because they thought they had better ideas about how to lower production costs on silicon transistors (and because it sounds as if William Shockley was kind of a jackass to work for). And while the Fairchild guys weren’t necessarily pursuing a dominant leader in silicon transistors, they were pursuing the leaders in the existing vacuum tube industry. End of aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-drives-rd-investment&quot;&gt;What drives R&amp;amp;D investment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markups evolve in the AA model endogenously based on how much each firm - leader, follower, outsider - invests in R&amp;amp;D. And the amount they invest depends on the gap in marginal cost between leader and follower, meaning the R&amp;amp;D investment depends on the size of the markup. Everything is jointly determined, and leads to the conclusion that the wider the gaps (the higher the markups) the lower the R&amp;amp;D effort by &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; leaders and followers (and outsiders). This isn’t a new result from AA, it is a pretty standard one from the Schumpeterian literature on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that those following firms are not selling any products, just spending on R&amp;amp;D. If they get very far behind &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the chance of getting lucky with hiring the right engineer (knowledge diffusion) is low enough, then they are looking at years of burning through funds before they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to pass the current leader. Thus they spend very little on R&amp;amp;D. Why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar logic holds for leading firms. If they are very far ahead then they are just burning R&amp;amp;D money for no significant gain in profits. Imagine each time they innovate, their marginal cost falls by half. At first, they are earning 33% of expenditures as profits (3 minus 2 divided by 3). If they innovate, that’s 66% (3 minus 1 divided by 3). If they keep on innovating its 83%, then 92%, then 96%, then 98%, and so on until they are taking almost 100% of expenditures as profits. At that point, why bother to innovate again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the gap in marginal cost is already very big (and thus the markup is very big) both firms have little incentive to innovate. Note that for the follower, this depends on a big gap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a low chance of making the lucky hire/discovery and catching up instantly. If the gap is big but there is still a good chance of making the lucky hire/discovery (knowledge diffusion), then the follower might still invest a lot in R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about firms that are “neck-and-neck” in the parlance of these models, meaning the gap in marginal cost is zero or very small? In that case &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the leader and follower have a lot of incentives to invest in R&amp;amp;D. The leader because it wants to retain its lead (and profits), the follower because just one or two innovations and they can become the leader (and take those profits). In this case we’ve got a small markup and a lot of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the outsider firms follow a similar logic to the followers, except they don’t care much about the gap. For them, all that matters is the chance of making the one big hire/innovation that catches them up to the leader. The higher is that chance, the more they invest in R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-the-facts&quot;&gt;Back to the facts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that set up, AA use this model to try and elicit the underlying source of the decline in business dynamism they documented about three sections ago. They consider lower corporate taxes (no), higher R&amp;amp;D subsidies (no), higher entry costs (no), and a lower chance of knowledge diffusion through that lucky hire/discovery (ding! ding! ding!). Before considering how that maps to the real world, let’s see that a drop in the rate of knowledge diffusion can explain the original facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lower chance of getting lucky, there will be fewer products in which the follower (or an outsider) has caught up to the leader, and more products with a clear leader and hence a gap in marginal costs. This will drive everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market concentration rose. If more products have a clear leader, then more products have all sales going to one firm, which will show up as more concentration of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average markups rose. If more products have a clear leader, then more products have a gap in marginal cost and hence have a high markup. So the average markup across products is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profit share of GDP rose. If more products have a clear leader, more products have markups that translate to profits. So the share of profits is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The labor share of GDP went down. If the profit share went up, the share of expenditures being paid as costs (i.e. wages) went down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The productivity gap rose. Productivity is just the inverse of marginal cost here. With less of a chance of knowledge diffusion the incentives to do R&amp;amp;D go down and the gaps in marginal cost (and productivity) between leaders and followers get wider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firm entry rate fell. With a lower rate of knowledge diffusion, there is less incentive by outsiders to try and enter a product line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The share of young firms fell. Same as number 6. With fewer outsiders entering, there are fewer new firms as a share of all firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of the paper is not that they can match these facts. Of course they can. They wouldn’t have put this paper out if for some reason the model was unable to match the stylized facts. The point is that they tied these facts to a feature of the firm decision process - the chance of getting lucky in R&amp;amp;D - that would not be obvious from just knowing the facts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it seems like knowledge diffusion (a lower chance of getting lucky in R&amp;amp;D) is a bit of a kludge, it is. But their more extensive paper provides a better case for linking this to tighter IP protections, and offers some evidence in support of that. Think of my example of getting lucky enough to hire away an engineer from the leading firm. In the absence of tight IP rules, that engineer can basically recreate the production process of the leader at the follower’s firm. But now imagine that IP rules get tightened up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That new engineer may know the production processes of the leader, but the follower cannot implement them because of infringement on a patent, and has to license the process. Of you can’t even hire the new engineer because they have a non-compete agreement in that product line. Either way, the incentives to invest in finding that engineer disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aside about Silicon Valley. The Fairchild story is something that is hard to fathom in the current IP environment. When the Fairchild guys wanted to leave Shockley, they left and started a direct competitor using a technique they had developed at Shockley. What are the chances you could get away with that now? Don’t get me wrong, there were plenty of IP issues in that era, and lots of stories about having to engineer new technology to get around patents by RCA or Western Electric. But the patent defenses seem less well developed, at least to this not-a-patent-attorney. End of this aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to AA’s evidence. They cannot document the actual rate of knowledge diffusion, but they can look at some other indicators of the flow of knowledge using patent data. Their first figure shows on the left the share of patents going to the top 1% of patenting firms, and you can see that this rose from about 37% to about 50% in the same time frame that markups rose. In the right panel you see the share of patents going to new entrants, and the decline in obvious. AA argue that this shows a concentration of knowledge in leading firms. I think what they want to argue is that the concentrating of patents at leading firms shows that they are more actively protecting IP than in the past to prevent knowledge diffusion. The increase in patent share by top firms (and the decline by entrants) is not evidence of more innovation by top firms, but rather more active IP protection of existing innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aa2019_fig9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patent concentration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their second set of data is on patent reassignments, which occur when one firm buys a patent from another. This is a method for a leader of creating a “patent thicket” that prevents followers or outsiders from matching their techniques and marginal costs. You can see in their figure on the left that the share of patents being purchased by firms that are already in the top 1% of patent holders increased over time, while the share of patents purchased by small firms declined. Again, AA would argue this shows that leaders are more actively trying to prevent catch-up by followers or outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aa2019_fig10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patent reassignments&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that you believe that these figures imply a decline in knowledge diffusion, then the qualitative story AA are telling has some backup. What their model did for them was allow them to quantitatively assess the role of knowledge diffusion, and find that it could be the dominant explanation for all of those facts they documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-this-missing&quot;&gt;What is this missing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AA model and explanation is very nice, and hangs together. It is important to note that AA have chosen &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way to model and think about the origin of markups. There are alternatives, and those alternatives could give you different ideas about why average markups rose. The choice AA made allows them to speak directly to the incentives for innovation. You could use a different model allowing for competition of some kind (e.g. Cournot or something more exotic) and perhaps get a different source of those seven facts. That isn’t a particular jab at AA. That is just the nature of attempting to model something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more tangible issue has to do with shifts in expenditure shares &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; products. One fact that AA don’t bring up, but which appears to be pretty robust, is that the average markup rose over time in part (large part?) because expenditures shifted away from low-markup products and towards high-markup products. That was part of the story I was telling in my prior posts about how higher average markups could be associated with higher productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AA’s model can match the evidence on higher average markups, but that is coming entirely from higher markups &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; product lines. In their model the expenditure on each product is fixed as a fraction of total GDP, so there are no shifts across products at all. In that sense their explanation is incomplete, and without accounting for that I’d say that we should treat the knowledge diffusion explanation with some skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculating, you might still be able to use knowledge diffusion as an explanation if you assumed that knowledge diffused more slowly in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; industries but not others. In the products where diffusion became harder you’d get widening gaps in marginal costs and higher markups, as explained above. Those products would look relatively expensive compared to everything else. If preferences were such that all products were complements to some extent, then the higher price for those products with less knowledge diffusion would result in an increase in our expenditures on those products. You could thus account for the shift in expenditure towards higher markup products, explained by the decline in knowledge diffusion &lt;em&gt;in those select products&lt;/em&gt;. You’d still have to show that markups were higher in those same products over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this post has already reached a ridiculous length, I’m going to stop here. Regardless of my complaint about the expenditure shifts and markups, the AA papers are still a useful structure in which to think about these issues. They are also give you a fairly streamlined structure to think about these leader/follower models that have been used in a wide variety of applications within the field of economic growth, and are worth reading just to see what the state of the art looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Demographics and the decline in business dynamism</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Aging-Growth/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Aging-Growth/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A second post in less than two weeks. It’s a Christmas miracle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read this blog for a while, you probably know that I’ve got a book coming out soon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2OTj5EY&quot;&gt;Fully Grown&lt;/a&gt; should be released on January 14th, just in time to get a jump on your Christmas shopping for 2020. The subtitle of the book is “Why a stagnant economy is a sign of success”. Without rehashing the whole thing (you should pre-order it now!) one of the core arguments in the book is that improvements in material living standards, women’s rights, and contraception led to a decline in fertility rates that has now put a drag on the growth rate due to population aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spend a lot of time in the book talking about things that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; responsible for the recent growth slowdown. In particular, I work through the evidence on the decline in “business dynamism”, which refers to a set of stylized facts about the speed at which jobs and establishments enter and exit the economy. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/haltiwanger_conference_draft.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161050&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25755&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the evidence. A core fact is that the entry and exit rate of establishments has declined over time, meaning that average establishment age has increased. A second core fact is that job creation and destruction rates also declined, meaning there is less reallocation of labor between establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no disputing those facts, but I argue in the book that this doesn’t account for much of the growth slowdown. Or at least, not much compared to demographic changes. If anything, I may be underselling the importance of demographics because the aging of the workforce could also be driving the decline in business dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That connection from demographics to business dynamism is made in a relatively new paper from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/25382.html&quot;&gt;Hopenhayn, Neira, and Singhania&lt;/a&gt;. It is new enough that I was only able to squeeze in a quick reference to it during the last stages of preparing the book. This post fleshes out the connection, explaining my understanding of their logic about how demographics link to business dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-the-facts&quot;&gt;Establishing the facts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we need to build up some additional facts regarding business dynamics. Yes, we know that establishment entry rates and exit rates have fallen over time. But for HNS, to understand this it is important to see how exit rates and establishment size change with the age of an establishment. Once we know these new facts, HNS are going to merge this information on establishment demographics with information on worker demographics and show how they are linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data I’m using here come from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bds.html&quot;&gt;Business Dynamics Statistics&lt;/a&gt; at the U.S. Census, the same source that HNS use. And before we keep going, let’s be clear that I’m talking about &lt;em&gt;establishment&lt;/em&gt; dynamics (e.g. individual Starbucks locations) as opposed to &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; dynamics (e.g. Starbucks as a whole). I don’t need &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/updatedpriors&quot;&gt;Decker&lt;/a&gt; flaming me all over Twitter for mixing the two concepts up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first fact is that the exit rate of establishments falls as they get older. The figure below shows this by plotting the exit rate in a given year for different ages of establishments. The multiple points (plotted using + signs) in each age category are observations from different years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bds_age_estexit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Estab age exit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishments of age zero are brand new, and by definition cannot have exited yet, so their exit rate is zero for all years. But one-year old establishments have an exit rate of 20-25 percent depending on the year. Many establishments fail right away. As you move to the right you’ll see how the exit rate declines with age, to under 10 percent for establishments that make it to 20 years or older. The “Censored” category captures establishments that were already in existence in 1977, which is as far back as the statistics go, so they could be any age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in the exit rate with age is consistent with a story that “only the strong survive”. Each year, presumably the poorest performing establishments in a given cohort are the ones that exit. That means the remaining establishments are relatively profitable, which one could easily imagine is a persistent quality of those establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might also expect that more profitable establishments expand, and thus that they have more employees. And this is what we see. The next figure shows that establishments tend to be larger as they get older. I’m always a little surprised that the slope of this relationship isn’t higher. Establishments that are one year old have roughly 10 workers, on average. But establishments that are 26 years old or more have only about 22 workers, on average. Some of this is due to looking at establishments rather than firms. Starbucks got much bigger as a firm as it aged by adding establishments, but each individual Starbucks didn’t necessarily get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bds_age_estsize.png&quot; alt=&quot;Estab age size&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there is an increase in average size as establishments get older, consistent with the “strong survive” story of establishment growth. This relationship of age to size, and age to exit rates, are going to be crucial to the HNS story about demographics and business dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last fact that HNS talk about is related to the size of establishments, but in focuses on the concentration of employment. This last figure shows the share of all employment in a given age category that is in establishments with more than 250 employees. This goes from well under 10% when establishments are age 1, to around 10%-ish when establishments are aged 21+ years. This isn’t a huge difference, but it again is consistent with the story that only the strongest establishments survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bds_age_sharesize.png&quot; alt=&quot;Estab age concentration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the these three facts from HNS, I’m going to include one more that is related to the average age of establishments. We know that the aggregate exit rate fell over time and the average establishment size rose; those are two of the stylized facts related to the slowdown of business dynamism. You can perhaps guess at this point that this is all consistent with an increase in the average age of establishments, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bds_age_year.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average estab age&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should ignore the little dip in age in the early 1980s, as this is driven in part by my assumption about how to treat the “Censored” establishments that already existed in 1977 when the statistics begin. But from about the mid-1990s to now you can take more seriously the information in the figure. The average age of establishments increased at the same time that exit rates fell, entry rates fell, and average establishment size increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-example&quot;&gt;A simple example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got these facts about establishments in place. Why should we think that the demographics of workers had anything to do with the downward trend in exit rates and entry rates? To see how this all works, let me start with a really naive example that ignores the age structure of establishments from the prior section entirely, and then fold that back in once we’ve got some logic built up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with 1,000 workers in an initial year. And in each subsequent year, the economy adds another 1,000 workers. This can be a net addition if you want (some existing workers retire, and extra workers get added), but that isn’t crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the absolute number of workers is rising over time (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, etc.) the &lt;em&gt;net growth rate&lt;/em&gt; of the workforce is dropping. In the first year, it is 100% (1000 to 2000), then 50% (2000 to 3000), then 33% (3000 to 4000), and so on. The net growth rate of the workforce doesn’t ever become negative, but it does decline towards zero as time goes on. Assume as well that the initial 1,000 workers are all 20 years old, and each year the age of the new cohort that enters is 20 as well. the average age of the workforce is climbing over time. It starts at 20, then goes to 20.5, then 21, then 21.5, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These demographics are really dumbed down, but they capture the crude features of the demographics of the late 20th and early 21st century we’re worried about. The workforce is increasing in absolute size, but the net growth rate is declining and the average age of workeres is rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now add in establishments. We’re going to assume that each establishment employs exactly 250 workers. For whatever reason, that is the only scale that works to make a establishment profitable. This “quantum” for establishment size is going to automatically reduce establishment dynamism over time, given the worker demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first year there are 4 establishments (1000/250). In year two, there are eight establishments. Then 12, 16, 20, etc. As with the workforce, you can imagine that there is exit of some establishments each year so that the number of new establishments is higher than 4, but the net addition of establishments each year is only 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;em&gt;net growth rate&lt;/em&gt; of establishments? That’s declining over time, just like the net growth rate of the workforce. 100%, then 50%, then 33%, then 25%, and so on and so on. We can also figure out the average age of an establishments. It starts at 1 year, then is 1.5 years, then 2 years, then 2.5 years, etc. These patterns, while not numerically accurate, capture the basic patterns seen in the literature on business dynamism; a falling net growth rate of establishments and an increase in average establishment age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. With average establishment size held constant, a falling net rate of growth in the workforce will generate a fall in the net growth rate of establishments and an increase in average establishment age. This just follows mechanically. The demographics can account - in my simple example - for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the change in business dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is more complicated that this, and we’ll get to that. But HNS calculate that this simple logic can account for one-third of the decline in the entry rate of new establishments. Holding establishment size constant, a falling growth rate of workers will mechanically create a falling net entry rate of establishments. So we are already part of the way to explaining the decline in business dynamism using only worker demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-establishment-demographics&quot;&gt;Adding establishment demographics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior section depended on the assumption that average establishment size didn’t change. But allowing for a realistic change in average establishment size would actually make the connection between worker demographics and establishment dynamics &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt;. We know from the data that older establishments tend to be larger, and that average establishment size and average establishment age have been growing as business dynamism declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s accommodate this in my little example. Say that every year a establishment stays open, it can absorb 50 more workers. Over the life cycle of a establishment, then, it employs 250, 300, 350, 400, and so on. In the first year, we again have 4 (brand new) establishments absorbing the 1000 workers. In year two, those four establishments can absorb 1200 workers (300x4), and the remaining 800 workers need only 3.2 firms (I wasn’t as clever with the numbers, so we’re getting fractional establishments here), for a total of 7.2 establishments, rather than 8 in the naive example. Average establishment size is now 2000/7.2 = 277, rather than 250. Most important, the net entry rate of establishments is now only 80% (3.2/4), rather than 100%. The increase in capacity of older establishments lowered the net entry rate, while also accelerating the increase in average establishment size and average establishment age. If you spin this forward you’ll see that acceleration continues over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even this simple two-period example reveals a number of new issues. Note that I assumed all 4 of the original establishments survived into period 2. What if one of them failed? Then the three remaining would only absorb 900 workers, and there would be 4.4 new establishments employing 250 workers each. We’d have 7.4 establishments with an average size of 270.3 and an average age of 1.41. The gross entry rate would be 4.4/4 = 110%, and the gross exit rate would 1/4 = 25%, for a net entry rate of 86%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we allow establishments to differ by age, the exact exit rate of establishments &lt;em&gt;by age&lt;/em&gt; and their size &lt;em&gt;by age&lt;/em&gt; matters to the evolution of average establishment size, average establishment age, and the net entry rate. The entire history of establishment entry and exit will matter in any given year, and the calculations quickly get very tedious. Nevertheless, the overall point holds. If as establishments age they tend to get larger and exit at a lower rate, then a decline in the growth rate of the labor force will push down the net entry rate of establishments even further than in my naive example, and push up the average age and average size of establishments even more. In short, the demographics of &lt;em&gt;establishments&lt;/em&gt; cannot be divorced from the demographics of &lt;em&gt;workers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of age-specific establishment characteristics can potentially allow worker demographics to explain even more than the one-third of the decline in establishment entry rates that the naive model could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-the-bells-and-whistles&quot;&gt;All the bells and whistles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HNS work through this all in much greater detail, and use numbers that actually match the observed data on establishment exit rates and size by establishment age. As I mentioned above, they find that one-third of the decline in the establishment entry rate can be accounted for simply by the decline in the growth rate of workers. But, in addition, the remaining two-thirds of the decline in establishment entry rates can also be attributed to the decline in the growth rate of workers given that worker demographics influence establishment demographics (and hence establishment size and exit rates). In short, the entry rate of establishments declined over the last twenty years because fewer establishments were needed to absorb the actual increase in the workforce that occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s very important to note here is that the entire history of the workforce demographics matters. It is not just the decline in the growth rate of the workforce over the last twenty years that led to lower entry rates. It is equally the fault of the very &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; growth rate of the workforce in the middle of the 20th century. During that period it took many new establishments to absorb the Baby Boomers as they entered the workforce. Hence the entry rate was high during the 20th century. But as those establishments aged, the ones that survived grew larger and less likely to go out of business. By the time we made it to the year 2000, there was a built-up stock of large, old, unlikely-to-exit establishments that was capable of absorbing most of the workers entering the workforce each year. There was little space for new establishments to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HNS go on to tie this together with several other stylized facts that have gained a lot of attention recently. Establishments with high markups would probably be more likely to survive, and a counterpart of higher markups is a lower share of output being paid to labor. Older establishments, then, would have higher average markups and a lower average share of output being paid to labor. Thus when the aging of the workforce pushes up the average age of establishments, the average markup in the economy would rise and the average labor share would fall. To some extent, all of the facts about business dynamism, concentration, and market power could be related back to changes in the demographics of workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the catch, here it is. The explanation that demographics of workers can explain all of the changes in business dynamics relies on the age-specific exit rates and sizes (and possibly markups and labor shares) of establishments. The data telling us how establishment age is related to exit and size (and markups and labor shares) are drawn from the time period in which the growth rate of workers was declining. There is nothing that says these age-specific establishment rates and sizes are a law of nature. Those rates and sizes might be unique to the last few decades given changes in anti-trust policies, regulations, trade, inequality, and so on and so on. Yes, the demographics of workers and establishments are going to be linked to some extent no matter what, but perhaps the real interesting action is in what determines the age-specific exit rates and sizes for establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving that objection aside, the HNS paper reinforces the argument in my book regarding the role of demographics in the growth slowdown. But perhaps more interesting than that, it provides an indirect argument for increased immigration. If you believe that the changes in business dynamics - lower entry rates, perhaps higher markups and lower labor shares - are bad for the economy, then you would want to change the demographics of this country to encourage more rapid entry of workers. To do that “natively” would require substantial changes in policy and social norms, and even if you were cool with reversing access to contraception and talking people into having more kids, you’d still need to wait about 20 years for all those new babies to hit the job market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you could effect an immediate increase in the growth rate of workers by expanding immigration rates. Allowing in more immigrants would allow more establishments to open, increasing the entry and exit rates, pulling down the average age of establishments, lowering their average size, and presumably lowering the average markup and increasing the average labor share. If you were worried about whether those immigrants would take jobs from existing workers, just remember that the economy managed to absorb all of the Baby Boomers into the workforce - while also expanding the labor force participation rate of women - during the middle of the 20th century without having a substantial effect on the employment rate of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revisiting the Kaldor Facts</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Kaldor-Update/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Kaldor-Update/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a looooong time since I posted anything, and I can assign blame to all sorts of things for this. Rather than get into those, I thought I’d come back to blogging by returning to the Kaldor facts. These are all observations about the stability of various macroeconomic aggregates that Kaldor used to motivate his own work on growth, and which were subsequently adopted by essentially everyone else who studied growth as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Kaldor facts are so embedded into macro and growth that they don’t actually get talked about much anymore. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v2y2010i1p224-45.html&quot;&gt;Chad Jones and Paul Romer&lt;/a&gt; provided an update to the facts. But that update was really to argue that facts about ideas, institutions, population, and human capital were all more interesting than the original Kaldor facts about physical capital. Not because Kaldor was wrong, but because they had been accepted so completely into the canon of economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m not ready to leave aside the original Kaldor facts alone. That is partly because Kaldor’s facts were originally some vague impressions based on very limited data from the US and UK; see footnotes 1,2, and 4 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/67/268/591/5248725?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;. This led me in a prior &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/BGP-Empirics/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; to ask whether the Kaldor facts were really as robust as we thought. I went back to these facts again this fall as part of my grad macro course, which involved updating the data I used in the prior post and looking across a wider set of countries. This led me to revise my view to be much friendlier towards the facts than before. This post is thus an exercise in arguing for taking the Kaldor facts seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean Kaldor’s original facts (Jones and Romer cite six) can’t be tinkered with. Some of them are redundant and others are useful only under some particular assumptions. What I present here is a set of revised Kaldor facts: (1) Stable growth in output per capita, (2) stable capital/output ratios, (3) stable rates of gross capital formation, and (4) a stable cost share for labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-growth-in-output-per-capita&quot;&gt;Stable growth in output per capita&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with what I see as the most basic Kaldor fact, and one that still seems remarkable when you think about it. The growth rate of output per capita (or labor productivity if you care to call it that) is very stable over long periods of time for most &lt;em&gt;developed&lt;/em&gt; countries. I’m going to throw some data in on developing countries to see how they compare, but this whole post is really concentrating on developed country facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-lny-bgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;BGP growth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first figure plots the log output per capita over time for a handful of countries. This handful was chosen very deliberately, as they all show remarkable stability in the growth rate of log output per capita over time. I’m going to tag this the “balanced” group of countries, given the stability of the growth rates. Yes, Mexico shows a break around 1980, but on both sides of that break the growth rate is stable. A last comment on this group is that not is the growth rate stable within each country, but the growth rates are similar across countries. There appears to be a common growth rate for output per capita over time for developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick mathematical aside. You can see that stability from the fact that the lines stay roughly straight. On a log scale, the slope of a line is the growth rate, so the fact that the slope stays the same for all these countries over time means that their growth rate is stable over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-lny-catchup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Catchup growth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second figure plots the log output per capita over time for a second set of countries, which I’ll call the “catchup” group (with the US as a reference). Here the pattern does not look like stable growth. You can see some experiences with rapid growth (e.g. high slopes) for Germany and Japan between 1950 and 1980, and for South Korea and China after 1970 or 1980, respectively. The growth rate for Nigeria is close to zero for most of the time period, with some acceleration towards the end of the figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This catchup group doesn’t seem to have stable growth rates. But if you look at Japan and Germany, you’ll see that they start to display that stability as they approach the US level of output per capita. South Korea appears to be headed that way as well. Whether China follows a similar trajectory to South Korea, with growth rates falling as it approaches developed levels of output per capita, remains to be seen. Whether Nigeria ever has the same takeoff as South Korea (or Japan earlier) also remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that the Kaldor fact about stable growth rates appears to hold in the limit, but not necessarily at any given point in time. Past experience - Japan, Germany, South Korea - suggests that the growth rate tends to become stable over time if it isn’t stable to begin with. That past experience is why you’d get most economists to predict that China’s growth rate will eventually stabilize at a rate similar to the one seen in other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-capitaloutput-ratios&quot;&gt;Stable capital/output ratios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second Kaldor fact is that capital/output ratios are stable. This one is going to be more tenuous than the stability of growth rates. Here’s the capital/output ratios for the “balanced” group of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-ky-bgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;KY balanced&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is stable…ish. Most of these appear to have been drifting upwards over time, from around 2 in 1950 to around 2.5-3 by 2015. One reason to not get too wired up is that the drift could be a data artefact. All the capital/output ratios are calculated from the Penn World Tables, and this may have to do with how output and capital are valued cross-country. If you look only at the US, and use just US national accounts data, you can see more stability in the capital/output ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-ky-us.png&quot; alt=&quot;KY US&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top line here is the capital/output ratio in aggregate, and while the scaling makes it look more dynamic, note that it stays within a narrower range between 2 and 2.4, with a less obvious trend upward. Moreover, the lines below that measure the capital/output ratio for separate components of the capital stock. Residential and non-residential structures (the dominant part of the capital stock) have fluctuations but very little obvious trend. Equipment also has no distinct trend. The only component that does is intellectual property, and that trend may be due to a lack of accurate accounting in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s hop back to the “catchup” group of countries. Here you could talk yourself into stability for Germany and China, perhaps. But there is clearly an upward trend for Japan and South Korea. But note that for both Japan and South Korea, the capital/output ratio does appear to stabilize in the 15-20 years. This would be consistent with the stabilization of their growth rates in the same period after they caught up to places like the US and UK in output per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-ky-catchup.png&quot; alt=&quot;KY catchup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it seems like I’m straining to make the case that the capital/output ratios are stable, I am. This is the least convincing of the Kaldor facts. The idea that capital/output ratios are stable, or are heading towards stability in places like Japan and South Korea, is informed in large part by the theory (Solow, neo-classical growth) that was built on to explain that stability. Thus there is some circular reasoning going on, and here’s where the biggest dose of skepticism about the Kaldor facts should be located. We can’t help but look at the Kaldor facts and see the Solow model at work, and infer that the capital/output ratios &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; stabilize eventually. But if you hang in there a few sections, I’ll throw in some other data on rates of return that corroborate the stable capital/output ratio story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a deep dark rabbit hole to stumble into here, involving the Cambridge controversy and Lant Pritchett’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Pritchett00.pdf&quot;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of using the perpetual inventory method to calculate capital stocks. As this post is already going to be long enough, I am going to skip past that hole for now. Let’s just say that the stability of the capital/output ratio is a very rough approximation of what we see in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-gross-capital-formation-share&quot;&gt;Stable gross capital formation share&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is never brought up by Kaldor explicitly, although Domar’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://laprimaradice.myblog.it/media/00/00/2491562877.pdf&quot;&gt;1946 paper&lt;/a&gt; does mention it as a stylized fact. The stability of the gross capital formation share of GDP is crucial in making sense of a stable capital/output ratio. It seems worth establishing whether the data support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I said “gross capital formation” share as opposed to “savings” or “investment” share. I’m getting more and more convinced that using either of the latter two terms adds too much confusion. It is nearly impossible to shed the colloquial meanings of “savings” and “investment”, even for economists. The gross capital formation share of GDP is the fraction of all real output that consists of new capital goods (e.g. new buildings, computers, or bulldozers). It’s “gross” in the sense that it includes capital goods purchased to replace old depreciated capital goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-sinv-bgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;GCF share&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is the share for our balanced group, and you can see the stability of that around a value of 0.2 to 0.24 for most of them. Dips and spikes occur for sure, but similar to before there is no distinct rise or fall in this share. The second figure here is for the catchup group, and we’ve again got a lot more excitement. Germany has a pretty stable rate. But Japan and South Korea have rates that are quite high for a time (0.3 or more) before they appear to revert back to a slightly lower rate. Nigeria had a distinct drop in the GCF share in the early 1980’s, but appears stable since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-sinv-catchup.png&quot; alt=&quot;GCF share&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the obvious odd duck here, with a share for gross capital formation that does appear to trend up over time. This trend has to end at some point, as the GCF share of GDP cannot go above one. But there is nothing here that says when it will stop trending up. This catchup group shows, as before, more movement than would be expected just looking at the balanced group. But compared to the capital/output ratio, the stability of the gross capital formation share seems more solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-cost-shares&quot;&gt;Stable cost shares&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaldor cited the stability of the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; share of labor and capital in his work. I’m going to alter his fact to refer to the stability of the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; share of labor. That is, I’m interested in the payments to labor (i.e. total wages) as a fraction of total costs (i.e. total wages plus total capital costs), as opposed to the fraction of total output (i.e. total wages plus total capital costs plus economic profits). Starting with an initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~rehall/Invariance_Properties_of_Solow.pdf&quot;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Hall, the cost share is more relevant to building a theory of production and growth (but perhaps not of distribution) than the output share. We can use the cost share, under mild assumptions, to infer the elasticity of output with respect to labor. We could use the output share, as Solow did, but that requires much stronger assumptions than I think we should be making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-klems-labsh-cost.png&quot; alt=&quot;Labor cost share&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure plots the share of costs going to labor, using data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldklems.net/data.htm&quot;&gt;KLEMS&lt;/a&gt;. These shares are available for fewer countries and years than the Penn World Table data that is used in the prior facts. What we can see here is something that looks stable…ish. The French data, in particular, show a decided decline in the cost share from 1980 to 1990. But for the rest, the shares don’t have distinct trends. That should indicate to us that the elasticity of output with respect to labor in any production function we use is stable over time. Stable elasticities are what the Cobb-Douglas production function provides, and hence these stable cost shares give us some reassurance that this production function is a decent approximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I should probably mention that these cost shares are &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. If you read through KLEMS documentation, which I made the mistake of doing over Thanksgiving break, you’ll see that this labor share probably isn’t quite right for our purposes. Worse, if you read through the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/davidbaqaee/&quot;&gt;four or five papers&lt;/a&gt; that David Baqaee and Emmanual Farhi have written, you’ll see that the correct way to compute the elasticity involves combining information on cost shares at lower levels of aggregation and weighting them with an I/O matrix. I am working on a paper on calculating the elasticities correctly. Okay, fine. I downloaded some data and have two scribbled note pages. But I have every &lt;em&gt;intention&lt;/em&gt; of working more on a paper calculating the elasticities correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment we’re going to stick with the crude cost shares in the above figure, because that’s what I’ve got. But check back with me &lt;del&gt;in a few months&lt;/del&gt; a few years from now, and I’ll get you a better answer on cost shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-rates-of-return&quot;&gt;What about rates of return?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An omission from my primary list of revised Kaldor facts is the stability of the rate of return on capital. And if you look at recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrohistory.net/data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; associated with a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrohistory.net/?sermons=the-rate-of-return-on-everything-1870-2015&quot;&gt;Jorda, Knoll, Kuvshinov, and Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find a lot of stability in the rate of return. Here’s a figure from the U.S., plotting five-year averages of the rates of return for three asset classes from 1890-2015. You get something similar for the other major developed countries in their dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes-return-usa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Returns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this needs to be one of the core Kaldor facts. It is almost redundant with the capital/output ratio. Or perhaps a better way to say this is that the stability of the rate of return provides some assurance that there is stability in the capital/output ratio. It would not be hard to convince me, however, that you could use the stability of the rate of return as the main Kaldor fact, and then see the capital/output ratio as redundant. But I like the capital/output ratio a little more because it speaks directly to how a growth model is built (i.e. the properties of the production function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-should-be-more-impressed&quot;&gt;You should be more impressed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you want to include the rate of return or not, the apparent stability of these different values is remarkable. Think of the technological, political, and social changes that have taken place over the last eighty years, if not the last 150 years. The structural economic changes alone - from agriculture to manufacturing to services - have been staggering. Yet despite all of that, the growth rate of output per capita continues to chug along at almost 2% per year in most developed countries. The capital/output ratio in those same countries tends to be somewhere between 2.5 and 3, the share of GDP that gets allocated to capital formation is around 0.2, and the cost share of labor is something like 0.60-0.65. Rates of return on capital didn’t fundamentally shift up or down. These economies have a remarkable stability to them at the macro level despite all sorts of instability and changes at the micro level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kaldor citation I gave you above is from 1957. Solow published his model of economic growth in 1956. These were economists talking about the inherent &lt;em&gt;stability&lt;/em&gt; of economies that had just whipsawed through the Great Depression and World War II. The Harrod/Domar model of growth that Solow was reacting to featured inherent &lt;em&gt;instability&lt;/em&gt;, which was seen as a feature not a bug because it accorded more readily with recent experience. Talking about stability in economic growth was, for the time, a rather radical idea. The Kaldor facts are interesting precisely because they are about stability, not in spite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The deep roots of development - Part 5</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-5/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-5/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my quest to fall behind on everything in my life, I left writing up the next installment of the deep roots reviews until well after I actually gave the lecture. Here I want to go over some thinking about how geographic, environmental, and/or agricultural characteristics led to variation in development across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-economic-activity-happens&quot;&gt;Where economic activity happens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/map_lights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Night lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is not uniformly populated, and neither is economic activity distributed uniformly across the globe. The map shown above is of night lights around the globe, and they are concentrated in several areas - the eastern US, eastern Mediterranean, eastern coast of South America, Europe, India, eastern China, Japan, and a few others. If you could zoom in, you’d see that even within those areas, the lights are not uniform, but concentrated in urban areas with big stretches of relative dark in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that this lack of uniformity is random, perhaps driven by contingent historical events or intitutions and culture. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/9760.html&quot;&gt;Michaels and Rauch&lt;/a&gt;, for example, find that urban areas in France are more likely to be based around old Roman towns or forts, meaning the modern location of most economic activity in France was determined in part by Julius Caesar. What Michaels and Rauch also find, though, is urban locations in Britain do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; share this feature. There, because urbanization completely collapsed after the Romans left, cities and economic activity are more likely to be organized around places suitable for river transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try to extend this kind of analysis to the entire world, and this is, in princple, what &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/133/1/357/4110418&quot;&gt;Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, and Weil&lt;/a&gt; did in a recent paper. They use night lights, as in the map above, to proxy for economic activity in each pixel of the map (there are 240,000 pixels). They then use a regression to explore how much explanatory power the geographic characteristics of a pixel have for those night lights. This is a stretch, but they are asking whether the world looks more like France, or more like Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geographic characteristics they use include some they relate to agricultural productivity: climate type (e.g. tropical dry forest, etc.), temperature, precipitation, number of growing days, elevation, latitude, and a measure of land suitability. Others they include relate to trade: being close to the coast, being on a river, having a natural harbor, and so on. You can quibble with the set of variables, perhaps arguing they are missing separate controls for soil types. Or you could quibble with the division into agriculture and trade, as being on a river or near a coast likely influences both. Nevertheless, their division isn’t particularly important, as all they are interested in is raw explanatory power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hssvtab2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Explanatory values&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Table 2, shown above, gives you the summary of their results. Combined, line (1) shows you that their variables can explain 46% of the variation in night lights. In other words, raw geographic characteristics can predict almost half of the dispersion in economic activity, meaning it is a bit like Britain. But the remainder is attributable to either other geographic factors HSSW don’t measure, or to “France-like” historical factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look down the table, lines (8) and (9) show you that of their variables, the ones they associate with agriculture are responsible for almost all of the explanatory power, while trade variables explain far less. And perhaps this isn’t surprising, as we might expect that people (and hence economic activity) would tend to cluster around areas where food was relatively easy to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hssvfig3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Predicted values&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the main story here is about these R-squareds, as opposed to causality, per se. If all you knew about the Earth was the geographic conditions, you’d be able to predict about 46% of the variation in the location of economic activity. This isn’t perfect, as the France/Britain story would suggest, and as HSSW’s own maps show. Take a look at their Figure 3, above, which plots their predicted level of economic activity by pixel from their regressions. It overstates the amount of activity in places like Cuba, the lower Mississippi and the east coast of Australia. And it misses the concentration of economic activity along the Ganges, Indonesia, or the large urban areas of Africa. It also understates to some extent the activity along the east coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; they can get some predictive power from geographic variables, you may be thinking. Most economic activity is clustered in a few areas (Europe, eastern US, east Asia) and since geographic characteristics tend to cluster as well (i.e. if one pixel is a jungle, the next pixel is likely to be a jungle as well), there has to be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; predictive power to geography. Does this tell us something useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSSW say yes, in part because of a second set of regressions they run. Because they have multiple pixels per country, they can include country fixed effects. In that case, the estimated effect of geographic variables is made only by looking at how geography correlates with economic activity &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; individual countries, and they are effectively throwing out cross-country variation in both geography and economic activity. In this case, they find similar patterns in the effects of geographic variables. For example, across countries places with tropical rain forests show less econoimc activity, but tropical rain forests also display less economic activity than other areas &lt;em&gt;in the same country&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence HSSW argue that there is something important about geography, in general, in determining where economic activity takes places. It wouldn’t make sense for the same patterns to hold within and across countries unless there was something meaningful about those geographic features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;population-density&quot;&gt;Population density&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSSW show these correlations, but do not open up the “black box” of why certain characteristics might be associated with economic activity. Other papers, however, do attempt to provide some mechanisms. One example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v101y2011i5p2003-41.html&quot;&gt;Ashraf and Galor&lt;/a&gt;, who looked specifically at the relationship of agricultural productivity to population density and living standards in the pre-industrial period. The “black box” here is a simple Malthusian model where population growth is positively related to living standards, and living standards are negatively related to the size of the population (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Malthus/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a more thorough summary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model says that higher agricultural productivity should be associated with higher population density, but unrelated to living standards themselves. And the empirical work Ashraf and Galor do in this paper confirms these basic predictions. To measure agricultural productivity they use two things, the time elapsed since the onset of settled agriculture associated in a given area, and a combo term that mixes together some of the measures HSSW use, but can be summarized as “inherent land productivity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/agfig3a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first figure shows the partial relationship (after netting out other controls) for the years since the Neolithic Revolution and population density. As you can see, the longer this gap, the higher the density. The notional story here is either (a) that there is some learning by doing going on in agriculture, and hence the longer you have been at it, the better you are or (b) people settled the most productive places first, and this is picking up some effect of that not captured by their other variables. The second figure shows a similar plot for inherent land productivity and density. Again, the more productive, the more dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/agfig3b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all consistent with the Malthusian black box they outline in the paper. It tells us that some of the reason for the strong geographic patterns HSSW find is that population density is higher in places with certain agricultural characteristics, and this almost mechanically is going to generate more economic activity. There is nothing Earth-shattering and counter-intuitive to these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things get a little more interesting is in thinking about what else might be going on in that black box. If there are scale effects, or agglomeration effects, or if more people means more minds thinking about how to generate non-rival ideas, then high population density generates more economic activity over and above the simple fact that there are more people. And Ashraf and Galor have a little evidence of this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/agtab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Neolithic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows the results from their Table 1, where they regress measures of technological usage (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v2y2010i3p65-97.html&quot;&gt;Comin, Easterly, Wong&lt;/a&gt;) on the time since the Neolithic Revolution, which remember tells us that populations are more dense. In the case of all three classes of technology, the longer a country/area had been practicing agriculture, the more advanced was its technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no strict causal experiment going on here, but it is indicative that places with an early start to agriculture, which probably was due in part to high agricultural productivity, ended up with technological advantages. Comin, Easterly, and Wong already traced the persistence of these technological advantages to living standards today. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Persistence-Technology/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on that a while ago. Thus it is plausible to argue that initial agricultural conditions are responsible for some fraction - perhaps in the neighborhood of the 46% that HSSW found - of the variation in living standards seen today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agricultural-types-and-deep-determinants&quot;&gt;Agricultural types and deep determinants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other attempts to dig into the black box connecting environmental - and in particular, agricultural - conditions and modern outcomes. These often work through the effect of particular types of agriculture on cultural norms or institutional structures. And those effects may even work to offset some of the positive advantages that high agricultural productivity may have brought through time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/litinafig9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Litina&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is from Anastasia Litina, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jecgro/v21y2016i4d10.1007_s10887-016-9134-7.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on agricultural productivity and cooperation. What she finds is that within continents, controlling for several other geographic factors, that places with higher inherent agricultural productivity are actually poorer than places with lower productivity. The figure above shows the residual relationship she estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Litina proposes is that while agricultural suitability was a positive for population density (and probably technology) prior to the industrial revolution, once the IR hit it became a detriment. In other words, agricultural productivity may have gotten you to the industrial revolution faster, but once there it slowed you down. The reason she proposes for this is not that high agricultural productivity may led you to specialize in certain goods with low productivity growth, which you might call the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.iitd.ac.in/~debasis/Lectures_HUL737/papers/paper2_JET%201992.pdf&quot;&gt;Matsuyama hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, but rather a cultural effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/litinatab6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Litina&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that places with &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt; agricultural productivity are forced to cooperate more to ensure survival, and that everyone meets subsistence. This generates more within-group trust, which is then useful once you hit the industrial revolution. Places with high productivity do not have to generate that same cooperate or trust, and that hinders their industrial development. Cross-country, Litina shows that in fact measures of trust do negatively relate to land suitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly related idea is that the specific crops you grow may require different levels of cooperation or trust. The necessity of managing large irrigation works would seem to be something that requires, and selects for, trust or cooperation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/603&quot;&gt;Talhelm et al&lt;/a&gt; looked at whether there were measurable psychological differences within China associated with whether people were from the rice-growing south, or wheat-growing north. The hypothesis was that the rice-growing region would have people that thought more holistically, and put greater weight on group outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/talhelmfig2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found significant differences between the rice and wheat growing regions. The figure here shows one example of their findings, on holistic thinking. A few key pieces of information here are that they administered these tests to non-farmers within these regions. This is not research showing that &lt;em&gt;farmers&lt;/em&gt; have different attitudes, but that even people who are &lt;em&gt;non-farmers&lt;/em&gt; share these attitudes based on the farming that traditionally took place within their geographic area. Implicitly they are arguing for a strong form of persistence in how agricultural type influenced cultural norms over time. A second note is that the did these tests for areas on the rice/wheat border, finding similar results, and that this is not driven just be gross differences in development or institutions between north and south China. It isn’t experimental evidence, but it is suggestive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A last example of how the particulars of agriculture might translate to cultural differences is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v128y2013i2p469-530.html&quot;&gt;Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn&lt;/a&gt;, who looked at how agricultural areas where the plow was used have very different attitudes towards gender roles than areas where plows were not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/agntab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;AGN&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These first results show a negative relationship of traditional plow usage and the participation of women in agricultural tasks. This is no country-level, but rather ethnic-group level. The difference in columns (1) and (2) is that the first uses the Ethnographic Atlas (limited data but more groups), while column (2) and the remaining columns use the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (more data, fewer groups). Regardless, more plow use is associated with less participation of women in these agricultural tasks. The speculation is that as animal-drawn plow use involves brute force, it favors male labor in agriculture, and this leads men to take on more of all agricultural tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/agntab3.png&quot; alt=&quot;AGN&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more interesting fact they document is that this persists to differces in labor force participation in 2000. Their Table 3 (which I cut off a bunch of ancillary crap from) finds the negative relationships you see. Fewer women work in a country when the ethnicities making up that country were traditional plow-users. The effect size is substantial, with a 15 point drop in participation comparing full plow-use to non-plow-use, on a mean of 51%. You also see an effect on firms with female ownership, although nothing for political positions. Similar to the rice/wheat differences, this suggests persistent cultural effects associated with the type of agriculture done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geography-history-and-long-run-outcomes&quot;&gt;Geography, history, and long-run outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all these examples is that while the gross level of agricultural productivity may be central to where economic activity takes place, the kind of agriculture done has important follow-on effects that affect how this translates to living standards. The different types of agriculture - plow vs. non-plow, rice vs. wheat, etc. - created variation in cultural and institutional outcomes that influenced economic activity as well. Therefore we have places of high agricultural productivity with very different long-run outcomes, and places of low agricultural productivity with very different long-run outcomes. There is no straight line from agricultural productivity to high GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, historical circumstances generated different responses to the agricultural conditions in place. To give you a stark example of what I mean, consider the distribution of “caloric suitability” across the world prior to colonization. This caloric suitability comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/bro/econwp/2015-5.html&quot;&gt;Galor and Ozak&lt;/a&gt;, and it is an attempt to measure the raw calories that an area of land could produce. In short, they look at the raw yield (in tonnes) that each crop in a given area could produce, multiply that by the calories per tonne, and then look for the maximum of total calories across all crops. Given the adjustment for calories, this tends to make places that can grow rice or potatoes look good (both very calorie dense) relative to other staples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/csipre1500.png&quot; alt=&quot;CSI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darker the green in this figure, which plots their data, the more calorie suitable a pixel is. The striking thing about this map is the massive calorie potential in the eastern US, and in the River Plate basin. But remember that this is for the per-1500 period before colonization. Those two areas were not, at that point, anywhere close to the most densely populated places on the planet, nor would either have been a clear leader in living standards. Pure agricultural productivity was not enough, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not? One theory is that their populations had simply not had enough time to “fill up” these areas and go through the learning-by-doing in agriculture that would have made them as dense and technologically sophisticated as China or Europe at this time. The Neolithic Revolution and settled agriculture only took place around 3-6,000 years ago in the Western Hempisphere, while it happened around 9-12,000 years ago in the Eastern Hempisphere. If the eastern part of North America and the River Plate basin had not been colonized, we might have predicted that the indigenous populations would achieve density levels and technological sophistication equal to, or surpassing, the Old World civilizations. That didn’t happen, of course, because of colonization. Geography matters here, but so does history. It isn’t plausible to explain long-run development ignoring one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The deep roots of development - Part 4</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-4/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-4/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all of you who guessed that I would fall behind in writing up these deep roots posts. I was able to get my notes together enough to cover material on culture during my class, but only now finally got around to writing this up as a post. This line of research is relatively new to me, so I’m going to apologize ahead of time for what is probably a less coherent take on the state of things than I’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales have a very nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v20y2006i2p23-48.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship of culture and economic outcomes, although it is now over a decade old and thus missing out on some of the latest work in this area. Nevertheless, it gives a good idea of what we’re talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspect of culture most used by GSZ is trust, meaning generally a willingness to trust strangers (non-kin). I’m going to leave aside any question of causality of trust on economic outcomes for the moment, but for now let’s just note that the evidence shows this aspect of culture varies a lot across populations. Using data on immigrants to the US (thus holding constant the institutional and economic setting to some extent) they show that people self-report being willing to trust others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Guiso_etal_2006_fig2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trust&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can see are big differences, with those of Japanese and Scandanavian descent reporting much more trust, and those from South Asia, the Carribean, or Africa reporting much less. The fact that this varies so much is alone quite interesting, as it indicates substantial variation in something you might have guessed only varied across individuals, but not systematically across populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, eye-balling this figure you get a quick sense of why people latched onto culture as an explanation for economic outcomes. The level of reported trust almost looks like it was rank-ordered by the average GDP per capita of the origin countries of different ethnic groups. China is probably an outlier, but in general we see relatively rich places with high levels of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, that is the kind of fact motivating this literature on culture and development. The idea is that there are certain cultural attitudes, or preferences, or norms, or what have you, that foster economic exchange, or innovation, or accumulation. Therefore development could be driven, in part, by having a specific culture that promotes those three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like the argument about institutions, that some foster exchange, innovation, or accumulation more than others. And just like institutions, there is a definitional problem. What exactly counts as “culture”? For my own purposes, and for the purposes of this post, I tend to think of it in the following way. Economic development involves a series of constrained optimization problems, which implies a set of preferences and a set of constraints. Things like geography (for sure) and institutions (kind of) set the constraints. Culture (kind of) is related to the preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preference-measures&quot;&gt;Preference measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look more carefully at people’s preferences along a variety of dimensions. One prime example of this is a recent paper on global preferences by &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/133/4/1645/5025666&quot;&gt;Falk, Becker, Dohman, Enke, Huffman, and Sunde&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.briq-institute.org/global-preferences/about&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; where you can download and use their data. FBDEHS worked with Gallup to run survey questions on preferences around the world, on a comparable basis, recovering about 80,000 individual responses in 76 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They group the preferences into six types: patience, risk-taking, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust. They use several questions to measure each of the six, and then combine the answers to those questions to get a single index of each one. A person’s risk-taking score, for example, depends on both a self-assessment as well as a value elicited from a standard set of questions asking that ask people to choose between a certain amount of money (e.g. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10) or a lottery (e.g. a coin flip for\inline&quot;/&gt;25 or zero). The materials on their site have full information on how each of these was measured and validated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the individual responses, they can do some simple country-level averages, and then look at how the different preferences correlate across countries. Their Table 3, shown here, shows those relationships. While there are a number of strong correlations here, it is not the case that these are perfectly related, meaning the six measures contain some distinct information. Patience and altruism, for example, are unrelated, implying one could think about them as different concepts. And given that kind of variation, it is at least plausible that one could identify different effects of patience and altruism on economic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/falketal3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Correlations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are some patterns that show up, or preferences that tend to move together. Trust, altruism, and positive reciprocity are all significantly and positively related, and one might term that package of preferences “prosociality”. Another set of characteristics that tend to move together are patience, risk-taking, and negative reciprocity. There is no obvious name for that correlation, although I’m tempted to call it “the revenant” because it calls to mind people willing to undertake a dangerous quest for revenge long after they are already dead. That is probably reading a little too much into the data, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More seriously, be very careful that this second set of correlations is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; “antisocial”, because it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the opposite of the prosocial characteristics. It is a different dimension along which people appear to vary. A country low in trust, altruism, and positive reciprocity would be “antisocial”, regardless of their patience, risk-taking, and negative reciprocity. One could also have a prosocial country that also rated high on the “revenant” characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/falketal10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Individuals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBDEHS also report similar correlations at individual level in their Table 10, which are interesting to compare to the country-level averages in the last table. Here, everything is signficant because they are using 80,000 individuals, but don’t let that distract you. What I see here is a weaker set of relationships, in terms of the size of the coefficients, but still some evidence of sets of characteristics. Prosociality appears again as a collection of positive reciprocity, altruism, and trust, and you also get the revenant package of patience, risk-taking, and negative reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers in this table are all excluding country fixed effects, meaning that they ignore the fact that in some countries that average level of trust, altruism, and positive reciprocity are high (and in others those are low), for example. These numbers show that taking those averages as given, within a country it also tends to be that people who trust &lt;em&gt;more than average for their country&lt;/em&gt; also are more altruistic &lt;em&gt;than the average for their country&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves the comparison of the two tables. Table 10 tells us that the prosocial characteristics tend to move together across individuals within &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; countries. More altruistic people tend to be more trusting everywhere, for example. Similarly, in every country people who are more patient tend to favor more negative reciprocity. There is nothing about this, however, that necessarily implies that the cross-country average relationships in Table 3 have to arise. It is quite possible to have these individual correlations within every country, but for the average level of trust or patience to be similar across countries. That is, Table 10 could be true, but Table 3 could easily have been full of zeroes, or even negative relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the numbers in Table 3 indicate that on top of those individual correlations, there is a similar pattern of variation in the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; level of trust or patience (or any of the other characteristics) across countries as we see with individuals. That means that the raw correlations across all individuals in the FBDEHS sample that underlay the packages of traits (prosocial, revenant) are even stronger than what you see in the individual or country level alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of research on the deep roots of comparative development, it is mainly the country-level variation that we’re interested in. And these preferences do appear correlated with country-level outcomes. FBDEHS look at raw correlations of each preference with several measures, which I cut and paste below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/falketal2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Characteristics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strong correlations - and let’s be really clear here that these are correlations - of GDP per capita with patience, negative reciprocity, and trust. In fact, patience, negative reciprocity, and trust are the three traits that show up correlated with most of the other measures in the table: democracy, life expectancy, the Gini, and homicides. If we take high GDP per capita, high life expectancy, and few homicides as a rough gauge of development, then developed places tend to have two traits, patience and trust, and probably tend to be risk-averse and put a high weight on negative reciprocity. Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being both prosocial (trusting) and patient (a revenant), they are not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the million-dollar question. Does being trusting and patient &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; you developed? Or does development &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; you trusting and patient? I am unaware of any clear evidence that answers these questions with any confidence. GSZ attempt to solve this causality problem by using religion to instrument for preferences. That … doesn’t make sense. It’s not any different than using say, the mortality of European settlers in different colonies to instrument for institutions, to pick a completely random example out of hat. In both cases, it is implausible that the only effect of the instrument (e.g. religion) on the outcome (e.g. savings rates, income redistribution) is through preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most research relies on what I’d call “verbal Granger causality”. The argument is that culture and preferences changes very slowly over time and were determined in the past. Therefore if we see a correlation of preferences with some economic outcome, it must be that the preference caused the economic outcome. But that isn’t quite right either. We know that history matters for economic outcomes, in the sense that past events can have persistent effects. So it is quite possible that there was some event in the “deep” past that made an economy poor, for example, and that also made its population less trusting of strangers, for example. The poverty persists, perhaps for reasons entirely unrelated to culture or preferences, and the lack of trust persists because cultural attitudes tend not to change much without a large shock. So when we look today, we see a poor country that is less trusting. But that doesn’t mean the lack of trust is why they are poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger here is that we’re doing ex post reasoning on cultural causes of development. Trust in strangers must be good for development because we see trust high in rich countries. Maybe trusting strangers is bad for development, but a host of other positive forces made trusting countries rich. Negative reciprocity is associated with higher GDP per capita, and you can tell yourself a story about why that could be. Perhaps because punishing cheaters deters others from cheating in the future, and that’s more important that rewarding good behavior (positive reciprocity). But if the coefficient on positive reciprocity had been significant, and that on negative reciprocity insignificant, you probably would have been just as happy with a story about how it is the rewards that matter more than the punishments. The point is that we don’t have any clear theory of which cultural preferences &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be good for development, so we may just be making stuff up based on correlations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;family-structure&quot;&gt;Family structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind the danger of ex post reasoning, and the lack of clear causal relationships, there is one aspect of culture that is of particular importance for studying development: family preferences. I’ve written on the blog a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/topic-takeoff/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; about how it is the change in the relationship of population growth and GDP per capita growth that generates sustained development, and not a specific technological revolution (e.g. steam engines). Thus cultural preferences regarding family size and structure can be crucial in understanding why some places developed earlier than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several papers out there now specifically looking at cultural differences in family preferences and modern outcomes. Benjamin Enke has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/23499.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that looks at how family structure is related to cooperation and moral systems, while Jon Schulz has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zP-HTvQ_2W2N6GS3TlMiRJcGgmZoA4ce/view&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that uses variation in exposure to the Catholic Church as an exogenous driver of differences in family structure, and hence of modern attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both papers document in detail what an anthropologist would tell you, which is that the nature of family structure differs a lot across cultures. Nuclear families or clans? Do you trace relationships through the father, the mother, or both? Do new couples co-locate near one branch of the family or another? Are there dowries or bride prices? Is cousin-marriage encouraged or banned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to those questions matter to the extent that they affect preferences for familiy size or quality/quantity of kids. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jecgro/v15y2010i2p93-125.html&quot;&gt;Alesina and Giuliano&lt;/a&gt; have a paper that looks at how variation in family structure (strong versus weak family ties is how they refer to it) affects fertility and several other outcomes. While those same authors along with Nunn have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/faseco/11986333.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on how plow use changed cultural attitudes towards fertility. The upshot of both is that these differences in preferences for family size are quite substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These papers are probably underappreciated for their importance to the story of the take-off to sustained growth. Differences in fertility preferences would affect the level of living standards in Malthusian settings for sure. Beyond that, differences in fertility preferences, and in particular how sensitive fertility was to living standards, could influence whether a given culture took advantage of a technological or institutional or historical shock to make the move to sustained growth. I think this is a place where it might be useful to step back from the almost purely empirical work being done right now in the deep roots literature, and reconnect explicitly with the growth theory on the origins of take-offs. That theory could provide some guidance to what exactly we should be trying to measure when we talk about culture or preferences for family size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cultural-variation&quot;&gt;Cultural variation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last point, let’s assume that there is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; causal about culture (related to families or otherwise) for economic development. Why do those country-level preferences vary at all? Aren’t we all sort of the same? I’ve read some with these questions in mind, but not deeply. One place to start is this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pseudoerasmus.com/2015/10/04/ce/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Pseudoerasmus, who takes a much deeper dive into the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main theories about the deep roots of culture are “evolutionary psychology” and “cultural evolution”. The former thinks about how natural selection operated to create specific “hard-wired” mental structures in humans in response to their environment. The latter adds that culture itself - knowledge, norms, rules - evolve as well. From the perspective of someone reading the economics literature on deep origins of development, the distinction between these fields is not that important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because for the purposes of the empirical work that people do in this area, it is environmental variation that is measurable and (arguably) exogenous. For the papers you’ll find in economics involving deep origins of culture, environmental characteristics are always on the right-hand side, and there is little to no explicit discussion of cultural evolution. Perhaps there is some hand-waving about how culture does evolve, but for the purposes of running some regressions, researchers almost always fall back on environmental features to explain (imperfectly, with R2 less than one) cultural variation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The deep roots of development - Part 3</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-3/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-3/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third entry in the series on deep roots, and it concerns institutions. One of the earlier (and most widely-read) series on this blog was the “Skeptics Guide to Institutions” which had four entries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-1/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-2/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-3/&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-4/&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those posts were particularly concerned with a critique of the cross-country empirical work on institutions that started around the mid-1990s as part of the cross-country growth regression literature, and was carried forward by the Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson study that used settler mortality as a source of exogenous variation in institutions. I don’t want to reinvent the wheel here, and those original posts are still a decent introduction to that set of papers. The TL;DR version of them is that I don’t find the empirical work convincing in establishing the proposition that institutions are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; fundamental determinant of comparative development. The main criticisms were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scales of institutional quality (e.g. “protection against expropriation” or “constraints on executives”) are used improperly in regressions. Treating these scales, which might run from 1 (worst) to 7 (best), as a continuous variable implies that the differences in institutions which exist can in fact be measured. That is, it implies that Liberia’s institutions (a 2) are better than Cuba’s (a 1) in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same way that Australia’s (a 7) are better than South Korea’s (a 6). There’s no way that is true. Better to use sets of dummies for each group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many cases institutional scales are just functioning as regional dummies. If you code a measure of institutional quality for European countries in 1750, and get that the Netherlands and England have a “3”, while Spain and Portugal have a “1”, and use this in a regression, then you may as well be using an indicator for “gray winters” versus “sunny winters”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instrumenting for the quality of institutions in colonies using the mortality rates of European settlers doesn’t satisfy the condition that the instrument (settler mortality) have an effect on living standards &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; through its affect on institutions. First, the measures of institutions are picking up far more than the specifics of constraints on the executive and the like, and second, settler mortality is like a summary statistic for biological/geographic conditions, which almost certainly have other routes to influence living standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence I don’t spend a lot of time in class going through the body of literature on these cross-country institutional studies. Nevertheless, I do spend time talking a lot about institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning that I didn’t proofread this carefully, so apologies for the typos that probably exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-question&quot;&gt;What’s the question?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key point in studying institutions, from my perspective, is being clear on what question we’re actually trying to answer. If the question is “Do institutions matter?”, then I think the answer is “Yes”, but that this answer is trivial. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; they matter. I don’t know that you can call yourself a social scientist and not believe that institutions, writ large, matter for economic outcomes. Markets (distorted or not) are institutions, and so even if you have some hardcore belief that you only want to study the &lt;em&gt;economics&lt;/em&gt; of something, you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; implicitly think that institutions matter. So the literature isn’t about convincing us that institutions are worth studying. They are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second kind of question is “Are institutions responsible for sustained growth and/or comparative development?” That’s a much meatier question, and there isn’t an obvious answer here, meaning it is open for study. The original cross-country literature had this as it’s main question, with one important modification. The question was usually a form of “Are institutions &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; responsible for sustained growth and/or comparative development?”, and the implied answer had to be Yes/No. That put too high of stakes on everything, as if there was some kind of Highlander-like cosmic battle going on amongst competing explanations and &lt;em&gt;there could be only one&lt;/em&gt;. One, there is no plausible way to pick one of those answers (although you would bet on “No”) using data, which would always involve uncertainty. Two, if you wanted to make this argument theoretically, then you can make the answer “Yes” just by redefining institutions until you have a nebulous enough concept to make it true by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less severe “Are institutions responsible for sustained growth and/or comparative development?” is plausible as a question, but again runs into the issue that we probably won’t be able to find enough data across a wide enough range of economies to really make any definitive conclusions. Which means that this question is something that will probably always be best addressed in a more speculative fashion by someone who is synthesizing lots of existing findings, rather than being pinned down by any specific regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of the papers in this literature do have specific regressions in them. What are they asking? I’d say it is something along the lines of “What were the observable effects of institution X?”. This is a much more modest question, of course. Once you answer it, you will not know whether institutions are the root cause of comparative development or not. But you will have a clear idea of the effects of institution X, and that may be an input into the synthesizing that you or someone else does later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the current state of the literature on institutions, from my perspective. In retreating a little on the scope of the question, we’ve been able to get a wave of very nice papers on specific institutions and their influence on economic outcomes over time. That’s the literature I focus on in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variation-in-institutions&quot;&gt;Variation in institutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features of this latest literature is the care it (usually) takes with identifying causal effects, motivated by the general evolution of economics in the last few decades. In the case of institutions, however, this has meant that nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the work now ends up studying consequences of a broader historical event, colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this involves an implicit assumption about institutions themselves. If you think that institutions are themselves a reaction to existing conditions (geographic, economic, political, etc..), and evolve to solve very specific problems, then there is essentially no way to evaluate the effect of institutions across any two units of observation. You could call this the “Ostrom problem” after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&quot;&gt;Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt;, who noted across a long career that local institutions to manage common pool resources (almost?) always had a clear rationale and were able to prevent environmental overuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this create an empirical problem? Let’s assume that I’m trying to compare several different societies (or countries, or villages, or whatever) with some difference in observable institutions. Even if I control for other observable characteristics (e.g. environmental or whatever) the the Ostrom problem is that the differences in observable institutions are, almost by definition, related to some other unobservable characteristics. In short, the Ostrom problem is that differences in institutions can never be thought of as random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to colonization. Most current work on institutions uses an aspect of colonization to find variation in institutions, because it might be plausible to argue that these institutions were imposed from outside, and not related to unobservables. In certain situations, you might even be able to argue that the institutional differences were the result of random chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example here is the paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v92y2010i4p693-713.html&quot;&gt;Lakshmi Iyer&lt;/a&gt; on the effects of direct versus indirect British rule in India. There, she argues that there was plausibly random variation in direct/indirect rule due to death of local rulers without heirs. For a specific time period, if there was such a lapse, the British took control directly, while in areas where an heir existed they took control and rule remained indirect. With this kind of quasi-random variation in institutions, she can do a well-defined empirical comparison, and finds that directly ruled areas have fewer public goods (e.g. schools, clinics, roads), even today, than indirectly ruled places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only works because there was a colonizer that had a level of control of the institutional structure, and thus the organic local institutions (which may have used adopted heirs or some other means of choosing a successor) were shut down. This same kind of logic is at work in most of the other institutional papers that have come out recently. By leveraging a colonizers power over a given colony, we can see some kind of clear exogenous variation in institutional structure that otherwise would be correlated with unobservables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;institutions-and-historical-persistence&quot;&gt;Institutions and historical persistence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about this in my original Skeptics Guides, but once we’re looking at the literature on effects of specific (often colonial) institutions, we’re talking much more about historical persistence than institutions &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. That is, a common goal in these papers is to establish that there are &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; differences in living standards associated with some &lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt; differences in institutions. That’s the purpose of Dell’s paper on the mining &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt;, and the purpose of Iyer’s paper on British rule in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institutions that they study no longer exist, of course. So the finding that the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; or British direct rule had negative effects on living standards is not a statement about the direct effects of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; institutions on contemporaneous populations. Instead, these papers establish that while once those institutions had &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; negative effect on the affected economies - although this is usually some kind of black box - these areas remained behind even after the institution itself was removed. These papers are evidence that there is some path dependence in development, and if you push down a place far enough, it won’t be able to catch up again. Note that this runs counter to our standard stories of growth and development, where negative shocks have temporary effects and forces of accumulation, catch-up, and/or convergence bring the economy back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sense that institutions like the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; or British rule can push an area below the threshold beyond which they cannot recover, then institutions matter for development for sure. And the evidence seems to keep accumulating that institutions of various kinds have these kinds of effects. The broader conclusion is thresholds exist, and that in turn means history matters for development in a powerful way. This gives us another reason for looking backwards for the sources of comparative development. Moreover, while the institutions literature was crucial in establishing that thresholds exist, that doesn’t limit us to thinking only of institutional reasons for falling behind. Anything, including geography or culture, could be a reason for falling below a threshold. It’s not institutions OR geography OR culture. It’s institutions AND geography AND culture.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The deep roots of development - Part 2</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-2/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Look at me, two posts in less than two weeks! I’m back with the second part of the series I’m writing on the deep roots of comparative development. Part 1 is here, and gave an overview of this literature. Here I’m gonna tackle some of the basic evidence on crude living standard differences that I think motivates studying those deep roots in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modern-living-standards&quot;&gt;Modern living standards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variance in measures like GDP per capita across countries today is well known. This variance is the source of the question “Why are some places rich and some places poor?”. To get some sense of this variation, here’s a density plot of log real GDP per capita across countries from Angus Maddison’s dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_dens_maddison.png&quot; alt=&quot;Density plots of GDP per capita&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line from 2010 ranges from about 6 (400-ish real dollars) to 10 (22,000-ish real dollars), or a factor of about 55. That takes into account some extremes, but the 90th/10th ratio is around 22, and even the 75th/25th ratio is still around 4. That is the scope of what we are trying to explain. How is it that some places produce four, or twenty, or fifty times as much as others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look backward in time, say at 1913 or 1820, then you still see variance, but it is lower. In 1913 the distribution spans almost 3 log points (6 to 9), meaning a ratio of about 20 between top and bottom countries. The 90/10 ratio is about 6 in 1913. Going back to 1820, you still see variation, although the span is only about 1 log point (6 to 7), for a ratio of about 2.7, and a 90/10 ratio of about 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_dens_maddison_lim.png&quot; alt=&quot;Density plots of GDP per capita&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue with the first figure is that it may be skewed a little by the fact that more and more countries are included as the year becomes more recent. The second figure here shows the same kind of plots using only the same 48 countries that appear in the 1820 data. What that does is lop off the bottom end of the distribution in 2010. The 48 countries that Maddison calculated GDP per capita for in 1820 are all somewhat well off in 2010, although not universally so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from these figures? First, we can see that the very wide distribution of GDP per capita today (2010) was much narrower about 200 years ago, which was right around the time the Industrial Revolution hit northwest Europe. (NB: Arguing about the timing and scope of the IR is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what I’m interested in here - 1820 is correct +/- 40 years either way). So with the onset of industrialization a major divergence took place that exaggerated the distribution of GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What isn’t obvious from the figures is whether it was the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; countries leading, and the same countries lagging, at each point in time. It could well be that the leading countries in 1820 got overtaken by poor countries in 1820, who are now rich. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. Rather than look at the density plots, the next figure shows log GDP per capita in 2010 against log GDP per capita in 1820 for the 48 countries that have data in both years. There is a clear positive relationship, meaning that the countries at the top end of the distribution in 1820 were still around the top of the distribution in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_comp_maddison.png&quot; alt=&quot;1820 versus 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not label these points with country names on purpose, because that way lies niggling arguments about specific cases, and for the time being that is not what I want to get into. Suffice it to say that there is evidence that leaders of 2010 were also likely to be leaders in 1820, although not universally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, a perfectly valid question here is whether we should buy Maddison’s numbers for 1820. It could well be that Maddison decided &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; that there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be a positive relationship, and then backed out his 1820 numbers to make sure the figure ended up right. I don’t think he explicitly did this, but it could well be that his implicit ideas about relative incomes based on his impression of history were leading him one way or another. But I think there is sufficient data from wage series accumulating to support the idea that Maddison’s numbers are &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; right in how they order countries in 1820.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second thing to learn from these figures - or at least the first one - is that the bottom end of the distribution is about the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; in 2010 as it was in 1820. The poorest places in both time periods have real GDP per capita of around $400. It’s not just that the top end saw faster growth from 1820 to 2010 than the bottom end, it’s that the bottom end doesn’t appear to have grown &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is trying to be too subtle, but I think this leads to a distinction in the following questions. “Why did poor countries today grow slower than rich countries from 1820 to 2010?” is not the same thing as “Why did poor countries today not grow at all?”. The latter question is more relevant to this deep roots literature. It is about what conditions led some countries to (eventually) make the jump to sustained growth, and what conditions have prevented (so far) others from making that same jump. I think the deep roots literature takes as a given that once you do make the jump, that there are strong convergence forces at work that will carry you to the neighborhood of rich countries, a la South Korea or Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps to explain growth &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, we need to reach back to 1820 or earlier and identify what created the variation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rich-populations-and-poor-populations&quot;&gt;Rich populations and poor populations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data in the prior figures is all based on country borders. And if you think about which ones are rich and which ones are poor, there are some regularities based on the origins of the people in those countries. Europe, and especially western Europe, is relatively rich. But so are places like the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, and Australia that are referred to as “Neo-Europes” because they are populated mainly be former Europeans. Looking down the range of GDP per capita, places like the southern cone of South America (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay) all have large groups of European descent, and they tend to be somewhat richer than places without European-descended populations, as in much of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Exceptions do exist, of course, as with South Korea or Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can look at some data to see that this is a bit more systematic, although don’t confuse this for any kind of causal claim, just an observation. Using data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v125y2010i4p1627-1682..html&quot;&gt;Putterman and Weil&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve created two plots. The first shows log GDP per capita in 2000 against the fraction of population in 2000 in a country that was descended from Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_pw_europe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Density plots of GDP per capita&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a positive relationship, dominated by the two groups at the tails with either 0% or close to 100% European population, but there are a fair amount of countries lying in the middle, and you can see that the relationship is consistent across the whole range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, next is the plot of log GDP per capita in 2000 against the fraction of population in a country that was descended for Sub-Saharan Africa. Here the relationship is negative, again dominated by countries in the tails, but with a consistent message through the middle of the figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_pw_africa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Density plots of GDP per capita&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way that, by chance, places with a high fraction of European descendants all happened to stumble onto the same package of institutions and technologies that stimulate sustained growth. Rather, this suggests that Europeans in general had, or developed, some institutions, technologies, or characteristics that were conducive to sustained growth. These features may have existed in some form or other back in 1500, which is how far back the migration data behind the figures goes, and Europeans just carted them around with them wherever they went. In that case, we’d want to look backwards in time to try and figure out what those characteristics were. On the other hand, it may be that the keys to sustained growth were not known in 1500, but that once some Europeans figured them out, it was easy to diffuse them amongst other Europeans. In that case, we still want to figure out what those charactersitcs were, but we’d also want to think about why diffusion was so easy amongst European populations (and so hard to other populations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be very clear that this is not a justification for doing ex-post reasoning about why Europeans are “better” than other populations. The leap to sustained growth by mainly European populations did not happen in a historical vacuum. The remaining populations of the world were not afforded an opportunity to see if they would find their way to sustained growth, and if that would diffuse among them in a similar manner, because the Europeans stepped in and colonized many of those populations first. As will be clear from this deep roots literature, colonization had significant and persistent effects on institutions, technologies, and other characteristics of these populations. It could well be that the only thing Europeans figured out and diffused among themselves was the willingness and ability to colonize other populations, and extract resources from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reversals-and-persistence&quot;&gt;Reversals and persistence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That colonization experience should make us wary of assuming that the characteristics of rich, European-descended populations today are instrumental for development. The variation in living standards that shows up in Maddisons data in 1820 is correlated with whether a country took off to sustained growth or not after 1820, but that variation reflects the experience of colonization that took place prior to 1820 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can go backwards to a period prior to colonization, then this can tell us more about the differences in 1820, and hence today. And it opens up the question of whether the places that did reach sustained growth today really were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; richer or better off (persistence), or whether they in fact were behind, and then overtook other economies (reversal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v117y2002i4p1231-1294..html&quot;&gt;Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson&lt;/a&gt; posed this question, and argued for a reversal. In order to do this, they had to use proxies for development, as GDP per capita numbers are not available for a lot of countries back to 1500, and furthermore they are going to be very noisy estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an aside to talk about why those might (or might not) be relevant measures of living standards. What we know from other areas of the growth literature is that the urbanization rate is highly correlated with living standards. The causation here is not clear - do cities drive growth, or does growth drive cities? - but the relationship shows up consistently over time. What Remi Jedwab and I did in a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/EEH_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; was to look back at this correlation in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_jv_urbrates.png&quot; alt=&quot;Urbanization and development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure plots urbanization and log GDP per capita for three different years: 1500, 1950, and 2000. Yes, you should be wary of the 1500 relationship because of data issues, but a similar line is going to show up for 1700 or 1820 or 1850. The point is that the correlation is positive over a long span of history. In our paper we talk more about why the slope changed over time, and the baseline &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; of urbanization rose across all countries, but for the purposes here we just want to see that urbanization and development are crudely correlated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That takes care of urbanization. The other proxy is population density. That one is a little tougher to argue is a good measure of &lt;em&gt;living standards&lt;/em&gt;, even though it might be a very good proxy for the overall level of productivity or technology. For the period of time that AJR are thinking about, 1500, we think that the world was operating in a Malthusian state, as most production relied directly on fixed natural resources and population growth was positively associated with living standards. We could do the theory on this, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v101y2011i5p2003-41.html&quot;&gt;Ashraf and Galor&lt;/a&gt;, to show that those living standards, in equilibrium, are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; related to productivity or technology, but rather to the parameters governing fertility and mortality behavior. On the other hand, population density &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be related to productivity or technology. Rather than looking at their theory, you could also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Malthus/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Malthusian mechanics I did a while ago. The point is that population density isn’t a very good metric for living standards, although it does give us some indication of economic possibilities, perhaps, of a country/nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to AJR, they showed that &lt;em&gt;among colonies&lt;/em&gt;, places with high urbanization rates or high population density in 1500 (e.g. North Africa, Mexico) were relatively &lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt; in GDP per capita by 1995. At the same time, places with low urbanization and population density in 1500 (e.g. Australia, Canada) were relatively &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt; by 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a more recent paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v6y2014i3p1-28.html&quot;&gt;Chanda, Cook, and Putterman&lt;/a&gt; has revisited this result in light of &lt;em&gt;populations&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to countries. These authors took the migration data from Putterman and Weil, and came up with the ancestry-adjusted measure of urbanization and density in each country in 1500. For example, in the original AJR data, the urbanization rate in Argentina in 1500 was essentially zero, and the population density was very low. But that reflects the populations that lived in Argentina in 1500. In the time from 1500 to today, Argentina was colonized and settled by the Spanish, and then received a major migration of Europeans like Italians. So the population in Argentina &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; is descended from populations that had very &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; urbanization and density in 1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_ccp_urb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adjusted relationship for urbanization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What CCP do is thus adjust each country’s urbanization and density in 1500 to account for this, and compare to the original AJR result. The figure here with the label “Panel A” is from their paper. On the left it shows the original AJR relationship of log GDP per capita in 1995 with the urbanization rate in 1500, and the negative slope - the reversal - is clear. But on the right, you have the CCP ancestry-adjusted measure of urbanization along the x-axis. This has a clear &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; slope. In other words, countries that contain a large number of people descended from places with high urbanization rates are still rich today. In that sense there was persistence in development over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/fig_ccp_dens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adjusted relationship for density&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do the same adjustment with the density data, as in the figure with label “Panel B” from the CCP paper. Again, the AJR result is on the left, and the CCP result is on the right. And again, there is a clear flip from a negative relationship and reversal to a positive relationship and persistence. Countries today that have populations descended from dense places are relatively rich today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us some evidence that population-based differences in living standards are persistent over very long periods of time. And the fact that these comparisons are only over former colonies removes some concern that we’re comparing apples (colonizers) to oranges (colonized). But there clearly remain some open issues here. The nature of colonization was not identical across these countries. The ancestry-adjusted population of Argentina is heavily European because colonization led, through disease or warfare, to an almost total annihilation of the original population. On the other hand, Nigeria’s population has very little European descent because the disease environment favored Nigerians and (perhaps because of this) Europeans never wanted to, or never could, undertake migrations like those into Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the CCP results confirm that there is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; persistent in development levels of populations. So if we want to understand why some of those populations were able to achieve the take-off to sustained growth, and some not, we want to keep digging backwards in time to see how they differed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-do-with-this-evidence&quot;&gt;What do we do with this evidence?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going forward, it may be worth thinking about what we’re up against in trying to explain current development patterns as a function of past development patterns. I think of it in two steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to identify characteristics of &lt;em&gt;populations&lt;/em&gt; today that differ by the level of development. We cannot just identify them, we need some causal evidence that these characteristics have a real effect on development. In addition, we’ll need some theoretical understanding, which need not involve any kind of fancy math, of what creates that causal link. To give you an example of what I mean here, think of trust in strangers. There is evidence that the amount of trust people have in strangers differs significantly between populations, with many rich populations displaying higher levels of trust than poor populations. There is some plausible evidence that trust in fact causes more economic activity, and the theory is that trust with strangers allows one access to a much wider possible set of transactions than limiting oneself to transactions with kin-group members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step, which is where the deep roots literature specializes, is in trying to identify the &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of the variation in that characteristic. Why would some populations be prone to trust strangers more than other populations? The data presented here are indirect evidence that this variation extends way back in time, and hence the source may extend way back in time as well. It could be specific historical events, such as evidence that trust within Africa was affected by the degree to which populations were exposed to the slave trade. Or perhaps there are environmental features that lead to variation, as perhaps different types of farming require different amounts of cooperation or work with possible strangers? Maybe it involves some combination of institutional and cultural shifts, perhaps related to marriage patterns? Regardless, we’re after &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; these characteristics, like trust, vary by populations, not just in identifying that they vary in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need both steps. The first step, by itself, can be interesting, but without the second step can deteriorate into “just-so” stories about why certain populations are “of course” better suited to development. The second step, by itself, can be interesting, but without the first can deteriorate into what amounts to overly complicated magazine articles without any relevance for current development. Which isn’t to say that every single paper has to tackle both steps, although some do. Our overall understanding has to involve both.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The deep roots of development - Part 1</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-1/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Deep-Roots-1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This coming semester I’m teaching a new version of my graduate course in growth and development. I’ve always taught a course that looks at long-run growth, but in the past that has involved at times a lot of theory (e.g. unified growth models) along with a close look at the literature on institutions as the origin of the take-off embedded in that theory. Some of the most popular posts I’ve every done on this blog were the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-1/&quot;&gt;“Skeptics Guide to Institutions”&lt;/a&gt;, which were in part lecture notes for that course. I also folded in material on the transition out of agriculture, something that I find an important part of this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that version of the course was always a little muddled in focus, and so for this semester my aim is to step back and start over. The plan is to take a more coherent look at the literature on “deep roots” or “comparative development”, which I’ll define in more detail below. As part of that, my plan is to offer a few lectures during the semester that give an overview of areas within that literature, and a bit of their intellectual history, to frame the specific papers that I’m going to have students dig into and the data work I’m going to have them do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to be a rough draft of the first of those overview lectures, introducing the field and the major ideas and themes we’ll be covering. The title of the post includes “Part 1”, which is intended as a commitment device. Part 2 should (no, will!) be about the evidence of persistence in economic outcomes over history, and the spatial pattern of development. Part 3 will be about institutions and colonization, Part 4 on culture and family structure, Part 5 on agricultural conditions, and Part 6 on cultural and genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timing-wise, those posts are likely to dribble out over the next few months, ideally well ahead of the scheduled date in class, but more realistically in some panicked burst of activity the day before. Once I get the final syllabus worked up, I’ll post that as well, in case people are interested in the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-deep-roots-or-comparative-development-literature&quot;&gt;What is the deep roots or comparative development literature?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any literature, there is no crystal clear definition. But I’d say that one characteristic common to any paper in this literature is that the underlying question is “Why are some places rich and some places poor?”. A second characteristic is that the answer involves deep-rooted characteristics of populations, rather than things like trade policy, macroeconomic stability, research subsidies, or social safety nets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more concrete, I think there are several key stylized facts or concepts that this line of research has either established or takes as given. Most people in working in this area would agree with most of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Differences in development are about differences in &lt;em&gt;populations&lt;/em&gt;, not countries. It is not that France, Germany, and the U.S. are rich, it is that places with people descended from ancient European populations tend to be rich. Conversely, places populated with descendants of ancient African populations tend to be poor. Note that this is not a statement about genetics. It is a statement about where the ancestors of current populations lived in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These populations differ substantially in not just the proximate sources of development (e.g. capital stocks and productivity levels) but in more fundamental characteristics like culture and institutions. Attitudes towards trust, patience, importance of family, and the like all show significant variation across populations. The assumption is that these characteristics drive the proximate sources of development, and some evidence is available to back this up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Differences in the cultural and institutional characteristics of population arose early. By early, I mean well before industrialization, conceivably back to the origins of settled agriculture in 10,000 BCE, and perhaps even before that. This does not necessarily mean that these cultural and institutional differences created differences in living standards in the past; the effect on development may have been latent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are differences in the geographic, biological, agricultural, and climatic conditions of the ancestors of current populations. Furthermore, cultural and institutional characteristics are correlated with these conditions (things like variability in rainfall, the presence of frost, the durability of stored food, the disease environment, access to the ocean, and so on). Whether those environmental conditions &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; (some of) the differences in culture and institutions is not as clear, but evidence is accumulating that they did.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like culture and institutions are incredibly &lt;em&gt;persistent&lt;/em&gt;. Even once the underlying source of differences in those things disappears (e.g. immigrants with different ancestral environmental histories come to the same country) their cultural and institutional differences remain, at least for several generations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While characteristics are persistent, specific historical events (e.g. the slave trade) appear capable of changing them demonstrably. Therefore these events can change the development possibilities of populations. Which events rise to this significance is an empirical question, but colonization is a common origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work I’ll cover in this course can usually be framed as speaking to one or more of these points. But taking them together, we can stitch together a rough story of why some places are rich and some are poor. First, we should rephrase that as “Why are European-descended populations so rich relative to the rest of the world?”. Second, we could answer it this way. They are rich because the environment they originated in favored the spread of cultural and institutional characteristics (e.g. trust in strangers, patience) that were conducive to economic growth. Given that advantage, they were able to avoid (and instead impose) significant negative historical shocks on the rest of the world that arrested or rolled back their development, giving rise to the observed difference in living standards today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;institutions-versus-geography&quot;&gt;Institutions versus geography?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words “institutions” and “geography” both show up in the points I just laid out. And that recalls a long-running debate on the relative importance of each. That debate, I think, has played itself out. Not because one side won and another lost, but because we appreciated that it was a stupid debate in the first place. There is nothing mutually exclusive about institutions and geography (and culture, for that matter) as determinants of development. Rather, both matter and interact with one another to create persistence differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate what I mean by comparing two excellent papers in this field. The first is Melissa Dell’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v78y2010i6p1863-1903.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the mining &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; in Peru. The &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; was a forced labor institution that required natives within a specific area to provide work in the Potosi silver mine for Spain. Dell established in her paper that areas today that were once inside the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; have lower development levels (on several measures) than places that were once outside the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second paper is Marcella Alsan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v105y2015i1p382-410.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the effect of the TseTse fly on African development. She builds a measure of the natural geographic range of the TseTse fly, based on temperature and rainfall. As the TseTse feed mainly on cattle, areas with the fly are less likely to use cattle in agriculture. Alsan shows that across ethnic groups, places exposed to TseTse flies did use fewer cattle, had less of a role for women in agriculture, and were less dense, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Dell’s paper shows the importance of an institution, while Alsan’s shows the importance of geography. And it would be ridiculous to think that one somehow invalidates the findings of the other. Both, though, show that aspects of development are persistently affected by deep roots, in a broad sense. In Dell’s case, there is a specific historical event - the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; - that continues to cast a shadow on development within Peru. Note, however, that her finding is not on the effect of that institution, per se, as the mita ceased to exist centuries ago. Rather, she shows that historical shocks have persistent effects. Further, you can easily read Dell’s paper as proof that geography matters, because the location of the &lt;em&gt;mita&lt;/em&gt; was driven by the location of the Potosi mine. Those places are poor because geographically they happened to be close to a major silver lode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Alsan, the deep root is the range of the TseTse fly, which affected how ethnic groups within Africa subsisted, with effects on the role of women and type of agriculture. Again, underlying conditions had persistent effects. Further, she shows that the TseTse itself has no direct effect on development (measured by night lights) once you control for ethnic group centralization prior to colonization. One possibility is that the TseTse - through changing density and other characteristics - influenced centralization, and hence influenced development indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that in neither case is there a bright line between institutions and geography (or culture). Both papers show the deep-rooted elements - in one case a historical institution, in another the geographic range of a pest - have detectable effects on development that can persist up until the present day. Both papers provided evidence that helped build the concepts in points 1-6 above, but neither invalidates the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empirical-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Empirical methodology and data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the concepts I listed, perhaps the other defining characteristic of this deep roots literature is the methodology used. It is an almost entirely empirical literature. Theory, when it is used, is illustrative rather than structural. Yes, it is easy to see the deep roots literature as an outgrowth of unified growth theory (UGT), which was much more theory-based. Oded Galor, the originator of UGT, is a central figure in the deep roots literature. But to my point, the theory embedded in his papers today is far more used to frame some simple hypotheses than to model history. If you want to think about how this deep roots literature fits with UGT, think of it as trying to figure out the specific conditions that determine why some places hit the take-off point, and when, rather than figuring out the specific mechanics of how a take-off works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodologically, the deep roots literature has ingested much of the logic of the causal revolution in economics, and combined that with two novel sources. The first source is extenseive GIS data, including night lights as well as datasets on inherent agricultural characteristics. This has meant the ability to do sub-country level empirical work at the district or pixel level, massively increasing the power of studies and allowing for better identification by being able to use fixed effects for larger political units and/or doing spatial regression discontinuities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second source(s) are bringing what I’ll call cultural datasets into the literature. One prominent one you’ll see is the Ethnographic Atlas, a compendium of anthropological information that was compiled from ethnic-group level studies, and coded into a common set of indicators for different cultural characteristics. For example, Alsan’s paper uses this to look at which groups within Africa relied mainly on cattle, and which had a significant role for women in agriculture, for example. Another is the World Values Survey (among others) that takes contemporary measures of cultural attitudes on things like trust, family, and the like. In both cases, further work has been done to link these cultural measures to maps, so that one can combine the geographic data with the cultural data, often at a sub-country level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these, researchers in this area have brought data in on genetic diversity of populations, language relationships across groups, historical city populations, and so on, in order to make their case. One of the prominent features of this literature is an explosion in datasets being brought to bear on relevant questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While welcome, there are potential issues with this expansion of data. The origins of the data are not always well understood, as one might expect within the field of economic history, for example. The Ethnographic Atlas, for example, is taken as given. It was coded mainly by a single anthropologist working from studies taken from over about eighty years. One can easily imagine that you could teach an entire class on a single one of the 1200-odd ethinc groups in the dataset, and debate the nuances of the family structure, gender roles, and taboos of that group. The idea of coding that nuance into, say, a five point scale for whether a group is “patriarchal” probably makes most anthropologists break out into hives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geographic datasets utilized also tend to be black boxes. A common source is something called the Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) project. This provides a pixel-level map of the world with numbers of the potential yield of that pixel for oats, for example. How do they arrive at that potential yield? Well, that depends on estimates of rainfall, sunlight, and soil type in that pixel, combined with plant-level parameters for needed water, length of growing period, and the like. What assumptions about how the plant is cultivated are built into the program the GAEZ uses to make that estimate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should remain skeptical - in the academic sense - of the work built on these kinds of datasets. I don’t think we have a good feel for how sensitive the existing results are to plausible variation in these sources. That is, one could easily come up with an alternative Ethnographic Atlas based on a new set of anthropologists coding the same source material, or come up with a new GAEZ based on a different set of assumptions from agronomists. Do those line up closely with the existing versions? If so, great. That might give us some assurance that the results we review are robust. But if not, things are very murky. The deep roots results could well fall apart with a slightly different version of the Atlas or GAEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;determinism&quot;&gt;Determinism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the questions about data quality, this literature seems to imply some strong versions of determinism. That is, were the places that are poor today doomed to be poor because of some historic event 500 years ago, or because of geographic conditions present 10,000 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I think it helps to think statistically, rather than in absolutes. And here I do not mean thinking about the uncertainty associated with point estimates of effect sizes, but rather the fact that in no case will any study show you an R-squared of one, meaning perfect prediction. To use a more concrete example, it is plausible that ethnic groups in areas where there were large returns to long-run investment in agricultural production may end up more patient in the long-run as well (as more patient people were selected for). There is a significant relationship of productivity with patience in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant relationship, but the R-squared is about 10%. That means that within the existing data, it is quite plausible to find pairs of ethnic groups that have different patience levels today even though they had similar productivity levels, or pairs with the same patience, but with different productivity. That’s all consistent with a statistically significant result and an R-squared of 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point on determinism, the results don’t mean that ethnic group A with higher productivity &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to have higher patience than group B with lower productivity. Imagine bootstrapping world history 10,000 times, starting over at like 100,000 BCE every time. The significant relationship of productivity and patience means that we’d expect patience to be higher in A than in B in more than half of those runs, but the R-squared of 10% it wouldn’t happen in all of them. It might be only that in 550,000 of the run does A have more patience than B, meaning B is more patient in 450,000 alternative histories. And yes, the positive relationship of productivity and patience could still be true even in those 450,000 histories because the patience of groups C, D, E, etc.. are all changing each time as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the explanatory variable here, agricultual productivity, is taken to be plausibly exogenous to the patience of the groups is immaterial. Lots of other things affect the patience of an ethnic group over and above the productivity level, and hence lots of things could have changed over the course of history to explain patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that geography (or biology, or agro-climatic characteristics) are significant for some cultural trait, institution, or level of development does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; imply a deterministic relationship exists, and that history is locked in no matter what. R-squares are not 100%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings in this literature do not mean it is impossible to change the development level of countries or groups today. But the deep-rooted nature of development may mean we have to find &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; policy levers to push, as we cannot go back in time and roll back colonization, or change inherent agricultural productivity, and so forth. This isn’t that different than what you’d find in an applied micro course on, say, education. There you might study the effects of a program to raise graduation rates, and see whether it is effective or not. But note that graduation rates in some schools were not low to begin with because of the lack of this program, they were low because of (probably) poor socio-economic backgrounds, a lack of resources, poor teachers, etc. Even in these worlds we spend a lot of time pushing &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; policy levers than the ones that created the situation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-forward&quot;&gt;Going forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of courses, this material will at times be breathtaking in the questions it asks and answers it proposes. It will seem presumptuous to explain cross-cultural patience as a function of agricultural productivity around the time of the Neolithic Revolution. And I think that researchers within this field do have a tendency to take big swings at big questions, and at times the prose in the papers will reflect that. Don’t let that put you off. The question still remains whether there is a valid empirical link established, and whether that link can be interpreted causally or just as a correlation. I think you’ll see that there is an accumulation of papers establishing strong links between deep roots and current development, and that this is not just a few odd results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, what I’m hoping to do from here forward (on the blog) is post subsequent parts with material on persistence, institutions and colonization, culture and families, agricultural productivity, and diversity. In the class itself, we’ll be covering specific papers within each section, and I’ll be trying to get my students up to speed on using R’s spatial packages to bring in some of the datasets used and replicating some basic results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/topic-deep/&quot;&gt;topic page&lt;/a&gt; up on my site already with all the existing posts I’ve classified as related to “deep roots”, so if you’re into this material feel free to have a poke around that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New evidence on convergence</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Convergence/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Convergence/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dev Patel, Justin Sandefur, and Arvind Subramanian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cgdev.org/blog/everything-you-know-about-cross-country-convergence-now-wrong&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the other day some new evidence on cross-country convergence. They showed that there is statisticaly significant evidence for unconditional convergence in GDP per capita across countries. I’ll get to more details below, but in short they find that poor countries grow faster than rich ones, on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They set this up as a counter-point to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20181207&amp;amp;&amp;amp;from=f&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; coming out in the Journal of Economic Literature by Paul Johnson and Chris Papageorgiou that says cross-country convergence doesn’t occur. The difference in the PSS post and the JP paper is that PSS look at relatively recent windows of data. For example, PSS look at whether countries that were poor in 1990 grew faster than rich countries in 1990 from 1990 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In constrast, JP appear to look at longer time frames. They find that there isn’t much evidence countries that were poor in 1960 grew faster than rich countries in 1960. This isn’t a contradiction with PSS. Both can be true at once. All PSS have done is indicated that around twenty-five years ago poor countries did start growing faster than rich countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of that finding is that poor countries are &lt;em&gt;converging&lt;/em&gt; to rich country GDP per capita. And while that statement is defensible, it does need a host of qualifications, because it doesn’t mean you should expect that developing countries are soon going to look like Western Europe. This post is meant to pick through those qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flavors-of-convergence&quot;&gt;Flavors of convergence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a better definition of convergence. There are two kinds. Within economics, they acquired particular names, and I’ll use those to be consistent with the literature. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence: this kind of convergence occurs if the growth rate of GDP per capita is negatively related to the initial level of GDP per capita. That is, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence is defined by poor countries growing faster than rich countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence: this kind of convergence occurs if the variance (or any measure of dispersion, really) of GDP per capita &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; countries shrinks. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence means the gap in GDP per capita from rich to poor gets smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence should imply &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. And in some cases it does. Rather than GDP per capita, think about the height of the people in my house. If you plotted the growth rate of height from 2005-2018 against height in 2005 for all four of us, you’d get a negative coefficient. My two daughters were really short in 2005, but grew very fast over the next 13 years. My wife and I were both relatively tall in 2005, but neither of us grew at all. That’s &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. In this case, if you looked at the variance of heights in 2005, that would be much larger than the variance of heights in 2018, and hence there was also &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For height, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence implies &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence because there is not any additional noise or variance in height to worry about. I don’t wake up every day and randomly find myself 6 inches taller or shorter than I was the day before. That ensures that as my daughters grow, they really do catch up in height. I don’t get randomly taller, and they don’t get randomly shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the case of economic growth, there are random shocks to GDP per capita. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence says that poor countries, &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;, grow faster than rich countries. But there will be instances where poor countries have really slow, or negative, growth sometimes. Think of currency crises or political upheavals. There will be some instances where rich countries experience rapid growth. With both of these things going on, it’s entirely possible that poor countries keep falling farther behind in terms of GDP per capita, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-&lt;em&gt;divergence&lt;/em&gt;, even though the poorer they get the faster they grow on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an analogy that could help. Imagine somone one juggling bowling pins. Gravity is like&lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. If the bowling pin is up in the air, then gravity is making it fall. But every time it reaches the juggler, she throws it back up in the air. This means there is always the same amount of dispersion in the location of the pins; some are up and some are down. In other words, there is a constant amount of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence, even though the &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence caused by gravity is always at work. If the juggler throws the pins up with a little less force each time, then the dispersion will decrease. If the juggler throws the pins up with more force each time, the dispersion will &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, gravity - &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence - is still working the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic shocks act a little like the juggler, except that it isn’t just the rich countries (the ones the juggler catches) that experience shocks (the toss in the air). But the principle is similar, which is that with sufficiently large shocks, the dispersion in GDP per capita may not fall, and could even rise, over time. This is true even though &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence, like gravity, operates on countries the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of cross-country comparisons, we’re mainly interested in &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence: is the gap between poor and rich countries shrinking over time? Observing &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence in the data does not tell us whether that is true. Now, some sort of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence to occur. At some point, a poor country has to grow faster than a rich country in order to catch up. But &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence isn’t sufficient for &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. The PSS result doesn’t mean that the dispersion of GDP per capita across countries got smaller, or will get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;convergence-speed&quot;&gt;Convergence speed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s leave aside whether &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence implies &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence for the moment. Let’s assume that the shocks are small enough that in fact, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence is implied. The next question is &lt;em&gt;how long&lt;/em&gt; it will take a poor country to close the gap with a rich country, and the actual coefficient that PSS estimate can tell us about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this, I need a little math. The convergence relationship that PSS estimate looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\ln y_{t} - \ln y_0}{t} = \alpha + \beta \ln y_0.&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is the growth rate of GDP per capita, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y\inline&quot;/&gt;, from some initial year 0 to year &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt;. This is related to the initial level of GDP per capita, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_0\inline&quot;/&gt;, on the right-hand side. The strength of that relationship is measured by the coefficient &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence means that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta&amp;lt;0\inline&quot;/&gt;, or that the growth rate gets smaller as the initial level of income gets higher. How large (in absolute value) &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; is determines how strong that effect is. The extra parameter &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\alpha\inline&quot;/&gt; is a baseline growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little re-arrangment of this gives us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\ln y_t = \alpha t + (1 + \beta t) \ln y_0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is the level of GDP per capita at time &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt;, given initial GDP per capita at time 0. That multiplicative term &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta t\inline&quot;/&gt; is the effect of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this, here’s a question we could ask. Given a poor country has &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_0^{Poor}\inline&quot;/&gt; that is only 10% of the value in a rich country, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_0^{Rich}\inline&quot;/&gt;, how long will it take (i.e. how big does &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt; have to be) before &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_t^{Poor}\inline&quot;/&gt; is 90% of the value in the rich country, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_t^{Rich}\inline&quot;/&gt;? Given the set-up, this &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen at some point. I didn’t add any of the shocks mentioned above that could keep spreading these two countries apart. &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence will eventually win out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this hypothetical time &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt;, we want that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_t^{Poor}/y_t^{Rich} = .9\inline&quot;/&gt;, which if you take logs and plug in from the above equation, gives us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\ln .9 = \alpha t + (1 + \beta t) \ln y_0^{Poor} - \alpha t - (1 + \beta t) \ln y_0^{Rich}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we can simplify this to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\ln .9 = (1 + \beta t) (\ln y_0^{Poor} - \ln y_0^{Rich}).&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also said that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_0^{Poor}/y_0^{Rich} = .1\inline&quot;/&gt;, so taking logs of that, we can plug in and get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\ln .9 = (1 + \beta t) \ln .1&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now re-arrange to solve for time &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;t = \frac{\frac{\ln .9}{\ln .1} - 1}{\beta}.&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how long it will take the poor country to go from 10% of rich country GDP per capita to 90% per capita. And you could plug in other numbers in the obvious spots here to think about the time to go from 20% to 99%, or whatever you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is that the absolute size of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; matters. The smaller is &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; in absolute value, the more time it takes to converge. Now, what PSS show is that in samples that only run through 2000, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; was about 0, which means that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t\inline&quot;/&gt; is essentially infinity. With no &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence, there isn’t a way for the poor country to ever catch up, because it doesn’t grow faster than the rich country. But with later samples, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta&amp;lt;0\inline&quot;/&gt;, so they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their biggest estimate value is &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -.005\inline&quot;/&gt;, not very big. Plugging that into the above equation implies that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t = 190\inline&quot;/&gt;, or it will take about 190 years for a country to go from 10% of rich-country GDP per capita to 90%. That’s a loooong time. So even in the case where we assume that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence leads to &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence (i.e. the ratio goes from 10% to 90%), and ignore the possibility that shocks keep spreading things out, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence may not imply much noticeable &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\sigma\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence over the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;absolute-and-conditional-convergence&quot;&gt;Absolute and conditional convergence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSS result of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -.005\inline&quot;/&gt; is small. At the same time, you will see references that the convergence coefficient is more like &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -0.02\inline&quot;/&gt; in the literature. Probably the most famous of these papers are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v106y1991i2p407-443..html&quot;&gt;Barro&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v100y1992i2p223-51.html&quot;&gt;Barro and Sala-i-Martin&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. There are a host of other papers offering more estimates of this parameter, but I think it is fair to say that -0.02 is a good eyeball average of those results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to be a little careful here in these older results to PSS. PSS estimate &lt;em&gt;unconditional&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence, meaning they just making raw comparisons of growth in GDP per capita against initial GDP per capita across countries. Their result implies that poorer countries grow (a little bit) faster than rich countries, and that this doesn’t depend (is unconditional) on characteristics of those countries. It says that if you are poor, no matter &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you are poor, you grow a little faster than rich countries, no matter &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original convergence literature did the same kind of unconditional analysis, and found nothing. That is the point, in some sense, of the PSS note. But that original literature did find evidence for &lt;em&gt;conditional&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. This means that if you look only at groups of countries that have similar characteristics (e.g. savings rate, human capital levels, etc..) then you find &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence in those groups - the poorer ones grow faster than the rich ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; groups, there was no tendency for &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. For example, if you looked only at the OECD countries, you’d see pretty strong evidence of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence, with an estimate of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -0.02\inline&quot;/&gt;, roughly. And if you looked only at the set of Sub-Saharan African countries, you’d see similar evidence of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence. But, there was no tendency for SSA countries as a group to grow faster than OECD countries. It was only that &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the group of SSA countries, poorer ones grew faster, and &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the group of OECD countries, poorer ones grew faster. You can find this notion of conditional - or “club” - convergence in blog-favorite William Baumol’s 1986 &lt;a href=&quot;http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Baumol1986.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that was one of the first to think about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different way of looking at conditional convergence was to use data on states or prefectures within a single country. They would all have roughly similar characteristics relative to countries (e.g. Texas and Florida differ, but that difference pales in comparison to the difference between Texas and Nigeria). And within countries, the evidence seems was clear that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence happens. Again, these coefficients were usually around &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -0.02\inline&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -0.02\inline&quot;/&gt; number implies much faster convergence. If you think of a poor state that had 10% GDP per capita relative to a rich state, then it would only take about 48 years for it to reach 90% of GDP per capita of the rich state. That’s, not surprisingly, one-fourth the time it takes a poor country to catch up to a rich one. It’s also one way of thinking about why we don’t see U.S. states with only 10% the GDP per capita of rich ones. Any time a gap opens up, it tends to dissipate. Although I need to note that there is some recent research saying that &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence across U.S. states no longer occurs. Let’s leave that aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which number is right, &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta=-0.005\inline&quot;/&gt; or &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta = -0.02\inline&quot;/&gt;? Neither. They don’t measure the same thing. The former is for unconditional cross-country convergence in the last 25 years, the latter is appropriate for conditional convergence or within-country convergence. Both can be true in their individual setting. Individual provinces within Kenya might converge very quickly, even though Kenya as a whole isn’t converging very quickly to U.S. GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-convergence-tell-us&quot;&gt;What does convergence tell us?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of convergence results depends on what you’re after. The &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; value that PSS report, similar to every other estimated &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt; value, tells you whether &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt; poor countries grow faster than rich ones. But that doesn’t make it very informative about any particular country. It certainly won’t tell you whether to expect some kind of growth miracle or disaster to occur in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I mean. I took the Penn World Tables, one of the datasets used by PSS, and plotted the data used to estimate &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. You’ve got the average growth rate of GDP per capita from 1990 to 2014 on the y-axis, against the (log) of GDP per capita in 1990 on the x-axis. The downward-sloped dashed line is the best fit to this data, and the slope of that line is about -.005, the PSS estimate of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_convergence.png&quot; alt=&quot;Convergence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can see that this hides a lot of variation. I labelled a few countries for reference. The USA and Japan (JPN), out on the right, can be the stand-in for the “Rich” countries. You can also see China (CHN) and India (IND), both of which had growth rates well above the estimated relationship, and hence they converged much faster towards rich-country GDP per capita. This would set them apart from the Central African Republic (CAF) and Zimbabwe (ZWE), who both started out relatively poor, but &lt;em&gt;shrank&lt;/em&gt; in terms of GDP per capita, and fell even further behind the USA and JPN. I also threw South Korea (KOR) in there, as an example of a country that closed almost the entire gap with JPN from 1990 to 2014, although many other countries with a similar level of GDP per capita in 1990 did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crude way of seeing how useful the &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence result is comes from looking at the R-squared of the regression that was used to estimate &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;. It’s 0.0462. In other words, 95.38% of the variation in growth rates from 1990 to 2014 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; explained by how poor a country was in 1990. Yes, there is evidence here for unconditional convergence &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;. But plenty of countries grew slower than necessary to converge to rich country levels of GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probably best not to think of unconditional &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence as representing some kind of structural truth about economic growth. If it were, you’d expect it to show up regardless of the exact time frame looked at, and PSS show that’s not the case. It’s better to think of it as a summary statistic of the general experience of poor countries in a given time frame. The PSS results tell us that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; changed around 1990 such that many poor countries grew faster than rich countries, relative to the period from 1960 to 1990. But it doesn’t tell us what or why it changed, or if it will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t make the PSS estimate spurious. It’s a nice descriptive result that tells us we should think a little more about what might have changed around those years, even if the implication of &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;-convergence from that period is not that strong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Involution and growth</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Involution/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Involution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a long-promised, long-simmering, longer-than-necessary post on the concept of involution. This term comes up often in discussions of Asian and/or Chinese development, or the lack thereof relative to western Europe. You can find several definitions, which is one of the problems with the concept. Perhaps the best way to give you a sense of what it means is that the Platonic use of the term would be “Rather than developing like western Europe, the Yangzi Delta involuted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the term arose because scholars were searching for some shorthand for what happened in Asian historical development (it is almost always used with respect to Asia) to set it apart from what happened in Europe. But just saying Asia was different than Europe is of no help; of course it is. So is there anything to the concept of involution that is useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geertz-and-the-subtleties-of-involution&quot;&gt;Geertz and the subtleties of involution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic reference for the term involution in the study of economic development comes from Clifford Geertz’ &lt;em&gt;Agricultural Involution: The processes of ecological change in Indonesia&lt;/em&gt;. Geertz borrowed the term from an anthropologist, Alexander Goldenweiser, who used it to describe a situation in which the crafts or art of a society stuck with the same fundamental patterns, only making them more an more intricate over time. Think of mosaic tiles, as an example. The patterns you create in a mosaic may get more complex, or the individual tiles may get smaller, or you may find a way to create new color. But in the end you are still doing mosaics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geertz adopted the word as a description of how village society in Indonesia, in particular in the sawah (i.e. paddy rice growing) heartland of Java, had adapted to the growth in population,  colonization by the Dutch, and the introduction of sugar as an export crop. His concept was that the villages did not change in a fundamental way during all this, even as they incorporated sugar production alongside paddy rice, but simply refined their existing social structures to further support small scale intense labor use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those social structures included how land and labor was rented, hired, and shared across families. Geertz’ idea of involution meant that this became more particular over time. Perhaps people went from renting “about half” of another families rice paddy to renting “the part of the field on the west side of a line drawn from between these precise property markers”. In a situation of high population density, it would matter whether a specific rice plant was on my side or your side of the line. The basic concept of renting in land to feed your family wasn’t different, the details of it were. This is why I think the mosaic analogy is nice. You can imagine the management of land being done at smaller scales - by the plant - rather than larger scales - by the paddy. Labor would have faced a similar process, going from generic obligations to hyper-specific exchanges of tasks and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; come along with all this refinement in agricultural relationships was growth in output per worker. That refinement allowed output per worker to tread water, given increases in population, and that was it. Involution, in Geertz’ original conception, was a situation where technological changes (i.e. sugar and rubber) as well as market changes (i.e. exposure to the Dutch trading network) occurred but there were no real changes in social structure or living standards. The village life in Indonesia did not become more market-oriented or commercialize in a way that one familiar with western European or English economic history might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geertz identified a few particular characteristics of Indonesia in the colonial period that were associated with involution. First, there was paddy rice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wet-rice cultivation, with its extraordinary ability to maintain levels of marginal labor productivity by always managing to work one more man in without a serious fall in per-capita income, soaked up almost the whole of the additional population that Western intrusion created, at least indirectly. It is this ultimately self-defeating process that I have proposed to call “agricultural involution”. (Geertz, p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the importance of the reaction of the marginal product of labor in rice by comparing the involution that occurred in the sawah areas of Indonesia with the areas that used swidden agriculture, which involves a slash-and-burn approach. In those swidden areas, which often became centers for rubber production, he finds some real changes in commercialization and market orientation after they are linked into the trading network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second important characteristic for involution was the relationship with the Dutch, and the idea that Indonesia was an effective agricultural hinterland for Amsterdam. Thus money and goods flowed back and forth, but there was almost no flow of &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;. For Geertz, the importance of this showed up in a comparison of Java and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… where Japanese peasant agriculture came to be complementarily related to an expanding manufacturing system in indigenous hands, Javanese peasant agriculture came to be complementarily related to an expanding agro-industrial structure under foreign management. … in Java most of the invigorating effect of the flourishing agro-industrial sector was exercised upon Holland, and its impact upon the peasant sector was … enervating. (Geertz, p. 135)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on to those distinct characteristics for a moment, because I’ll come back to both in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crude-conception-of-involution&quot;&gt;The crude conception of involution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Geertz, the term involution has been applied in a number of different contexts to describe development, or its lack. But relative to Geertz, the actual content of the term “involution” devolved from subtlety to something more crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not the only example of this, one particular example I’ll use is Philip Huang’s work on Chinese development, both in his 1985 book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CKh7lf&quot;&gt;Northern China&lt;/a&gt;, and in his 1990 book on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ChnJGB&quot;&gt;Yangzi Delta&lt;/a&gt;. The 1990 book defines three types of agrarian economic change. First is development, where output expands faster than labor input, so output per worker grows. Second is intensification, where output expands at the same rate as labor, so that output per worker stays the same. Finally is involution, which is when output expands but at a slower rate than labor, so that output per worker falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicit in Huang’s conception is again the idea that there were technological and market changes taking place in the Chinese economy, but what differed by region within China, or differed between China and Europe, was the response to that. For much of China, and in particular the Yangzi delta, Huang identifies the outcome as involution, by his crude definition. He identifies changes in the type of crops produced (e.g. cotton, tobacco, maize, silk) and in family work relationships (e.g. an expansion of women’s role in producing goods for sale), but does not explore, like Geertz, the refinement or hyper-specialization of agrarian relationships within these areas. Here’s a sense of what Huang has in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there was no modernization at all in crop production and rural industry in the Yangzi Delta. The example of the first three decades of postrevolutionary rural China, during which income per farm person stagnated side by side with vigorous agricultural modernization (tractor plowing, electrified pumping, chemical fertilizers, scientific seed selection, and the like) and urban development, should alert us to the fact that neither is precluded by involutionary growth. (Huang, 1990, p. 129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the concept of involution is really about how per-worker or per-capita outcomes could stagnate or fall despite expansions in absolute output, and at the same time as significant technological and commercial changes. This observation of involution is argued to run back through Chinese history to at least 1350, the scope of Huang’s book. That isn’t to say that Huang ignores social changes, quite the contrary. Most of his work is about changes in social structures that took place in adapting to the technological and commercial changes that occurred. But that social change was not involutionary in the sense that Geertz proposed originally, as it was not necessarily a refinement of existing social or agrarian structures, but rather involved significant changes in those structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a side debate to be had on whether output per worker in fact &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; stagnate, and even if it did, whether that level of output per worker was similar to those seen in Northwest Europe, or below. Huang’s argument is that it did stagnate, and stagnate at a low level, as opposed to the California School types like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pRsKOQ&quot;&gt;Ken Pomeranz&lt;/a&gt; who argue that the Yangzi, at least, was equivalent in living standards to Northwest Europe just prior to the Industrial Revolution. You can see the May 2002 issue of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-asian-studies/issue/3222A2F9ADD9F71283E271C62C080486&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Asian Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which contains several articles dedicated to this debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;involution-as-a-malthusian-outcome&quot;&gt;Involution as a Malthusian outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave aside the debate on the exact level of living standards in the Yangzi. Let’s assume that in fact they were stagnant, and stagnant at a low level. Is the term involution useful as an analytical concept for understanding why this occurred? No, as far as I’m concerned. At least involution in the crude sense of the word. It is just a word that describes what happened, but doesn’t contain any explanatory power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t know why we need that extra word when we’ve got a reasonable analytical model - Malthus - that allows one to think about the relationship of output per worker, population density, and the effect of changes in technology. It has the advantage of being clear on how those things are related, while also highlighting that the response of family formation and fertility to changes in output per worker is central to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malthus, however, does not appear in either Geertz or in Huang’s work, not even in passing. For Geertz, this is particularly odd, because he absolutely nails the logic and implications of a Malthusian model. Here he is talking about how the sawah system adapted to new crops (e.g. sugar) and what it implied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… the maintenance of the marginal productivity at some low but nearly constant (or perhaps gradually declining) figure. It merely gave the multiplying Javanese a bigger pool in which more of them could tread water. (Geertz, p. 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wondered if Malthus was so &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; to Geertz that he didn’t seem worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Huang’s work - and in similar pieces - the absence of Malthus is more problematic. The goal was to explain the historical development of China, or perhaps another area in south or southeast Asia. In particular, explain why that historical development differed from Europe, given that many similar forces were at work in the sense of technological change, commercial changes, and expansion of markets. Because the outcomes differed, the presumption was that Asian development must have operated on different principles than European development, and hence involution became a necessary concept to set it apart from whatever it is that happened in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that the Malthusian setting can make sense of the both outcomes. Which is not to say that Europe and Asia were identical outside of some lucky shock, or that the particular institutional details are not important or interesting, but just that we don’t need a new concept like involution to think through the two settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard Malthusian model has two key elements. A negative relationship of the size of population and living standards (thanks to a fixed or nearly fixed resource base), and a positive relationship of population growth and living standards. Put those two together, and you will find that no matter where you start, the economy is pushed towards a stagnant level of output per worker. When times are good, more people are born/survive, the population grows, and this drives down living standards. When times are bad, few people born/survive, and the population shrinks, and this drives up living standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And stated that way, the logic of the Malthusian model doesn’t seem to apply. Because what we see is that the population in China, or Indonesia, or any other setting that involution was applied to, &lt;em&gt;grew&lt;/em&gt; over time, almost without fail. It would seem that the Malthusian model can get the stagnation right, but cannot fit with the rising population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that it can, without too much trouble, once you allow for persistent growth in technology/productivity. The implication of this in the Malthusian model is one thing that is not very intuitive. If there is productivity growth, then there should be growth in living standards, right? Kind of. As long as population growth is still positively related to living standards, then productivity growth means growth in living standards, which increases population growth, which puts a drag on growth in living standards, as per the basic version of the Malthusian model. At some point, the positive effect of productivity growth will be offset by the negative drag of population growth, and output per worker will become stagnant again, even though productivity growth continues. And even more important, at that stagnant equilibrium in living standards, population growth remains &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can see where I’m going here. It is entirely within the scope of a Malthusian economy to have (1) positive productivity changes such as increased commercialization and market access, (2) positive population growth, and (3) stagnant output per worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the idea that output per worker was &lt;em&gt;falling&lt;/em&gt; over time, as Huang argues? That is still understandable within the context of the Malthusian setup. If the economy is not right at the equilibrium point, but has living standards slightly above that equilibrium for whatever reason, then those living standards fall over time towards the stagnant level. And that transition can take a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time. Nippe Lagerlof has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nippelagerlof.com/research/happening/Waves_April_2018_post.pdf&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; working out that given realistic demographics, it can take &lt;em&gt;centuries&lt;/em&gt; for a Malthusian economy to slide towards its equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you could call all this involution if you felt like it, but I’m not sure why I need a special name for a particular outcome of the model. I’d reserve the term involution for Geertz’ specific idea that - as part of a Malthusian outcome - the agrarian or social relationships within an economy may evolve to a more refined or hyper-specialized version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing that the Malthusian model suggests we should be concerned with are the particulars of fertility rates and family formation. To the extent that fertility is more, or less, sensitive to living standards, this will change the speed at which a Malthusian economy reaches equilibrium, and determine the level of living standards in that equilibrium. You can see this, and all of the nuances of the Malthusian setting, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw0xeVVYEG5XOURQR1Y1NnFKVlk/edit&quot;&gt;Ashraf and Galor&lt;/a&gt; paper, which has a very nice simple description of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, work on involution does not delve into the particulars of fertility and family formation. Huang’s two books, for instance, contain only a few passing asides to fertility rates and why they may have been insensitive to living standards (which would have led to low equilibrium living standards and slow transitions). Using the concept of involution, as opposed to a Malthusian setting, buries the importance of these fertility/family differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-made-asia-different&quot;&gt;What made Asia different?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine. Let’s say that crude involution is just one kind of Malthusian outcome, and a more sophisticated take on involution looks like Geertz’ definition. Why did crude involution appear to occur in Asia relative to Europe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first answer to that is that crude involution &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; take place in many places in Europe, for a lot of Europe’s history. Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Leisure/&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that specific places within Europe - like England - may have been experiencing growth in output per worker earlier than we thought, most of Europe up until the late 1800s could still be explained within the context of a Malthusian model with modest gains in productivity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there were places within Europe that saw commercial and market development which did lead to growth in living standards, urbanization, and ultimately sustained growth earlier than this occurred in most of Asia. Why or how did they accomplish that, if they were stuck inside the same Malthusian framework?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a partial answer - since this is essentially one of the all-time big questions in historical development - let me reach back to those two specifics that Geertz talked about with respect to Indonesia. They were, to remind you, the use of paddy or wet rice cultivation, and the absence of an urban outlet within Indonesia itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of an urban outlet comes about because it offers an alternative sink for population growth and economic activity. This tweaks the original Malthusian setting. Now, rather than saying that living standards in general have a negative relationship to population size, we would say that agricultural output per worker has a negative relationship to agricultural population size. If there is an urban area that absorbs some population growth, then the growth rate of &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; population is not as large. If the flow to urban areas is large enough, it could be that the technological change in agricultural outweighs the drag from agricultural population growth, and output per worker in agriculture could go &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall the comparison of Japan and Java that Geertz made. Beyond the lack of a sink for population growth, urban areas offered another avenue for productivity growth, due to agglomeration effects and/or gains from specialization. Hence Japan could benefit from textile production as it developed, whereas Indonesia could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese experience included urban areas, so it was not a “pure” Malthusian economy like Indonesia, in that sense. Despite that, it still ended up in a Malthusian situation of stagnant or falling output per worker, and the urbanization rate did not appear to change much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I think the second factor identified by Geertz, the nature of paddy rice production, played a role, at least for the development of the Yangzi (North China relies on different kinds of crops). As Geertz noted, and other sources corroborate, the marginal product of labor in rice production does not fall by much as additional labor is applied.  That means output per worker in those agricultural areas is insensitive to growth in the number of workers. This turns out to be both good and bad for those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the good side of the ledger, this means that living standards in agricultural areas can handle population growth without too much trouble. The drag from population growth in a Malthusian setting is more muted in areas with paddy rice production. On the bad side of the ledger is that this means population continues to grow. In the end, what you get is that the speed at which the economy approaches the Malthusian equilibrium is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slow. That’s good in the sense that output per worker stays about the stagnant equilibrium level for a long time, bad in the sense that output per worker is falling for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of this effect of rice production. Remember, with an urban outlet, this can slow down population growth in the agricultural area, and thus output per worker in agriculture faces less of a drag on its growth. But this doesn’t seem to have helped in China. Here’s Huang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The involuted peasant economy was able to support very large and complex cities, and, by extension, also a highly advanced elite and urban culture, even if the surplus above subsistence produced by the average cultivator shrank from the diminished marginal returns that came with involution. The paradox is poorly understood. Large cities and advanced urban cultures are commonly associated with rural prosperity, but I would like to suggest that the opposite was actually the case in much of Chinese history. (Huang, 1990, p. 332)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contend that the nature of rice production resolves the paradox. With rice production, rural output per worker is insensitive to rural population growth. Even if there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of rural-to-urban migration, there is little effect on rural output per worker. The benefits of having urban outlets in China - at least the Yangzi - were not very big in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this compare to Europe, and why does it explain the lack of crude involution? In European agriculture, there are reasons to think that the marginal product of labor is very &lt;em&gt;sensitive&lt;/em&gt; to the amount of labor used. This is both bad and good. It is bad, because any population growth in agriculture leads to significant loss of output per worker. But that means population growth slows down quickly, and hence the transition to the Malthusian stagnant equilibrium is very fast. So one reason Europe may not have looked like it “involuted” is that it did not have long, drawn-out, transitions towards the Malthusian equilibrium, as in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with respect to urban outlets, which Europe had as well, the nature of agricultural production is helpful. When population growth in rural areas slows down thanks to urbanization, this has a very big effect on output per worker, because agricultural output is so sensitive to the amount of labor. Thus, relative to rice-growing areas of China, Europe had an advantage in that any urbanization it generated created this follow-on effect of improving rural output per worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular story about the difference in the sensitivity of output to labor in different types of crop systems is something I’ve done a lot of work on - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/assets/eber_voll_2016.pdf}&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dvollrath/Crops/blob/master/Drafts/Constraint-Master.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/assets/JOEG_basis.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways, it was thinking about involution that got me there. Another incredible source of information on this topic is Francesca Bray’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CHXFpb&quot;&gt;The Rice Economies&lt;/a&gt;, which remains one of the very best books I’ve ever read on comparative development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven’t even touched on differences in family formation and fertility patterns, which would add a whole other layer on top of this. But as I’ve reached well over 3000 words at this point, we’re going to leave that aside for the time being. Suffice it to say that they were different (perhaps endogenously) and would have contributed to the different outcomes in a Malthusian setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-involution&quot;&gt;What about involution?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does that leave me with respect to involution as a concept? It is crucial to distinguish Geertz’ notion of the refinement of agrarian practices from the cruder notion of stagnant or falling agricultural output per worker. Geertz’ definition of involution is useful in thinking about how the specific agrarian institutions we observe today came about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the crude definition of involution is just a synonym for “Malthusian equilibrium allowing for technological change”. It isn’t a problem to use a single term to stand in for a more complex phenomena. It can save you some time typing. But I think using the concept of involution without its Malthusian context leads one to do a lot more analytical work than necessary. The Malthusian setting gives you clear guidance on what the proximate determinants of living standards are. And in the Asia/China setting, the experience with respect to commercial and technological changes are not necessasrily paradoxes or mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The inverse relationship of farm size and productivity</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/IFSP/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/IFSP/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I am an intellectual raccoon, it was not a surprise that when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GarettJones&quot;&gt;Garett Jones&lt;/a&gt; dangled a shiny object called “the inverse farm-size productivity relationship” in front of me on Twitter, I grabbed hold with my dirty little paws and would not let go. The inverse farm-size productivity (IFSP) relationship is something I’ve been interested in since grad school, and my very first published paper has a strong link to the subject. But from Garett’s tweet, and the responses it gathered, I realized I was a bit behind on the state of this literature. And so here we are, with a blog post that is something of a literature review and something of a critical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origin-of-the-ifsp-fact&quot;&gt;The origin of the IFSP “fact”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by laying out what precisely the IFSP is, and some of the implications of it. Note that by the end of this post you’re going to see that the “standard” IFSP I’m going to define here is probably wrong. Still, I think it is worth seeing what it is, where it came from, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we now think it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IFSP is the stylized fact that small farms have higher yields per acre than large farms. In other words, output per hectare is decreasing with the number of hectares, and hence there is an &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; relationship of farm size (hectares) and productivity (output per hectare).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ur-text of the IFSP literature is &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Sen_1962.pdf&quot;&gt;Sen&lt;/a&gt; (1962). Yes, I know &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/alexander_chayanov_the_theory_of_peasant_economy.pdf&quot;&gt;Chayanov&lt;/a&gt; (1926) talked about it as well in the context of Russia, but Sen’s work managed to kick off a few &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; worth of research, whereas Chayanov’s observation just kind of sat there for years without much response (at least within economics). Sen’s original 1962 paper does not provide any direct evidence of the IFSP. He simply mentions this (his Observation III) as something that is found to be generally valid in Indian agriculture. This conclusion is based on a series of Farm Management Surveys done in the 1950’s for several Indian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dig back through a lot of the papers that follow Sen, they take this relationship for granted, or also appeal to the Farm Management Surveys (FMS). One of the first papers I know of that actually documents the IFSP in the FMS data is from &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Saini_1971.pdf&quot;&gt;Saini&lt;/a&gt; (1971). He looks, using the farm level data, at the elasticity of total output with respect to operational area of a farm. If that elasticity is less than one, it means that if farm size increases by 1%, output increases by &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than 1%, and hence the yield falls. This constitutes the standard method for establishing the &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; evidence that the IFSP exists. Here’s the original table from Saini,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_saini_tab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Saini Table 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the column labelled &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\beta\inline&quot;/&gt;, which is the estimated elasticity. You can see that all but three are less than one. And if you look at the second to last column, at the t-values, you see that in all but six we can reject the hypothesis that the elasticity is equal to one. On this basis, Saini says that the stylized fact of the IFSP used by Sen and others is a robust statistical relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at this point (roughly) forward, the notion that the IFSP exists in some manner becomes an established fact. Note that this is based on Indian data alone, and it will remain the case throughout this literature that the IFSP is centered around a discussion of Indian agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t until a book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Agrarian_Structure_and_Productivity_in_D.html?id=i_4DAAAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;Berry and Cline&lt;/a&gt; (1979) that we get some evidence for the IFSP in different contexts. The strength of the book at the time was pulling in farm-level data from different countries, and exploring the existence of the IFSP directly in each. The book, in addition, documents a number of other facts related to farm-size distributions. Which is the reason that the U of Houston library copy has lived in my office for the last 13 years (and, uh, sorry about all the margin notes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, Berry and Cline examine the farm-level data and find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brazil: a regression shows a negative relationship of yield (output per area or &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?output per\inline&quot;/&gt; value of land) and the number of hectares on a farm, including controls for regions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Colombia: summary data shows that yield (gross or net farm income per hectare) falls as you look at groups of larger and larger farms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Philippines: regression shows a negative relationship of yield (value-added per hectare or just value-added from crops per hectare) and the area (total hectares or cultivated hectares) across farms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pakistan: regression shows a negative relationship of yield (gross farm income per acre) with area of farms (in acres), including controls for regions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Malaysia: summary data shows that yield (value-added per hectare) falls as you look at groups of larger and larger farms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry and Cline also confirm the findings for India. So between that original work on India, and the Berry and Cline evidence from different settings, the IFSP appears to be an established fact by the early 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unleash-the-theorists&quot;&gt;Unleash the theorists!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not let a good stylized fact go to waste, so the economics profession quickly got to work theorizing about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the IFSP existed. And that theorizing invariably started with an observation that the IFSP &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; exist given standard assumptions about how markets work. In this, the IFSP literature echoed the literature on share-cropping, the existence of which had bothered economists all the way back to Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people can buy, sell, or rent land at will, and if people can work for wages, hire workers for wages, and work on their own farm, and if people are attempting to maximize the profits they earn using their land (if they hold some), &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; there should be no IFSP. Let’s say you have a large farm and a small farm , but the yield on the large farm is lower than on the small farm. The large farmer should offer to rent the small farmer some land. This will reduce the large farm size, but raise its yield. The small farmer would get larger, and their yield would fall. It will make sense to keep renting land to the small(er) farmer until the yield is identical on the two farms. This will maximize the total output across the two farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get to this idea if we think of the labor market. The large farmer should offer to hire the small farmer for some hours of work. This would lower the yield on the small farm (less work is getting done) but raise the yield on the large farm (more work is getting done). For a similar argument, the large farmer should keep hiring more hours of the small farmer’s time until the yield across all hectares is identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the yield on every hectare of land should be identical, no matter the actual ownership structure of the land to begin with. The fact that the yield is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; identical means we are sacrificing some output. And that didn’t make sense. It’s seems like leaving dollar bills on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But simply assuming that developing country farmers had some inability to see, or desire to take advantage of, these kinds of gains, was a no go. T.W. Schultz had just published in 1964 &lt;em&gt;Transforming Traditional Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;, which argued that you had to see farmers in these situations as keen optimizers (given their poverty, probably even more concious of maximizing their output than someone with a more secure lifestyle). So the game was to see under what conditions it would be that the IFSP was the result of many farmers pursuing an optimizing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Sen_1966.pdf&quot;&gt;Sen&lt;/a&gt; (1966) laid the groundwork for one common explanation, which was that the labor employed on small farms was effectively &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than hired workers. Because of a surplus labor situation (a la Lewis), or a low opportunity cost for family labor, or a monitoring cost for hired workers, the effective wage of family workers is lower than hired workers. For a small family farm, they “hire” more of their own labor given the relatively low effective wage, raising the labor used per hectare and raising yields. For large farms, which must hire in workers, the effective wage is higher, and as such the large farmer employs fewer workers per hectare, resulting in lower yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; sense, and you can get into the weeds on what exactly creates the monitoring costs or lowers the opportunity cost for family members. But regardless of the explanation, a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Feder_1985.pdf&quot;&gt;Feder&lt;/a&gt; (1985) established that a single market failure like this (i.e. a wedge in the effective wage of otherwise similar workers) cannot, by itself, account for the IFSP. The basic argument is that if only one market has a wedge or friction, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; markets can all adjust such that the IFSP doesn’t hold. To see this, imagine that our large farmer and small farmer exist as before, and that the large farmer hires some of the small farmers time (or hires some of the small farmers family members) to work on their farm along with the large farmers own family. You could still raise output by having the large farmer rent some land to the small farmer. You would do this until the two farms were just of the size that both were being worked by only family workers. Thus output would be higher, and the work effort (and yield), would be identical across the two farms. What Feder showed was that it took &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; market failures to deliver the IFSP. We need &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; an implicit difference in wages between family and hired labor, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an inability to rent in/out land, for the IFSP to persist. So in that sense, the presence of the IFSP implied multiple failed or missing markets within developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there was another line of reasoning that attempted to explain the IFSP, based on risk. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Srinivasan_1972.pdf&quot;&gt;Srinivasan&lt;/a&gt; (1972) and &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Barrett_1996.pdf&quot;&gt;Barrett&lt;/a&gt; (1996) both considered that production risk could induce small farmers to work more intensely on their farms. A simple way to see this is to imagine that each farmer has a fixed minimum absolute amount of output that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to produce to survive, and that there is some uncertainty in how much their land will yield in a given year. For a small farmer, they raise the expected yield of their land to a very high level so that they eliminate (or make insignificant) the risk that a bad year leaves them without enough to eat, and hence they achieve high yields on average. For the large farmer, the absolute amount of output they get from their land is large even in a bad year, so they do not need to jack up their expected yield. Hence their observed average yield is low. (As an aside, Barrett’s paper is really about price risk for output, not risk in the actual output itself, but the same ideas apply.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A last theoretical possibilty, one that tended to get dismissed for the most part, is that farm production is decreasing returns to scale. That kind of assumes the answer, but still left open the question of why the large farmer didn’t split up or rent out their land to smaller farmers. You still needed some kind of missing market to make this one work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-redistribution&quot;&gt;Implications for redistribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the IFSP in practice is that it makes a case for redistribution of land. Regardless of the underlying source of the IFSP, its presence implies that one could &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; a break up of large farms into small farms, and have higher output overall. You might imagine that one can use the extra output to compensate the large farmers, or perhaps you don’t care. Regardless, the implication of the IFSP is that an unequal distribution is &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; related to lower output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vollrath_fig1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Vollrath 2007 Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by they way, was what my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/assets/ajae_2007.pdf&quot;&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt; was about. I looked at the relationship of country-level measures of land inequality and the output per hectare from agriculture. I found a negative relationship, and you can see the raw version of this in the figure, and it holds up once you control for all sorts of other things that you’d expect affect yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This negative relationship is consistent with the presence of the IFSP within countries. In fact, it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; makes sense if there is an IFSP to begin with. If you dare to believe my results were causal - and you’d want to be very, very hesitant to do that - then it supports that idea that redistributing land (lowering inequality) would be associated with higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the IFSP provides one justification for land redistribution, including a relatively recent (2009) &lt;a href=&quot;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/Ag_Land_Redistribution.pdf&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; from the World Bank on the prospects for land reform. See Chapter 1, page 11. When you combine this IFSP with the historical origins of land inequality in many locations (i.e. elites controlling vast amounts of land) then the rationale for land redistribution comes from both notions of fairness and from notions of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trying-to-explain-it-away&quot;&gt;Trying to explain it away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fairness motive for redistribution can exist independently of the IFSP, the efficiency argument cannot. And starting not long after the IFSP became a stylized fact, people have asking whether the IFSP represents a real efficiency loss, or just a spurious correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main argument for a spurious correlation is that the IFSP ignores differences in land quality. If small farmers simply have better quality land, then the higher yields make perfect sense, and there is no mystery about missing markets or effective wages. More important, if land quality differences explain the difference in yields between small and large farms, there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; efficiency argument for redistribution. No matter who farms a given plot of land, we’d get the same yield, so the distribution is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Carter_1984.pdf&quot;&gt;Carter&lt;/a&gt; (1984) looked at the IFSP within India, and compared farms within given villages, on the assumption that land quality was similar within a village. He found the IFSP was slightly weaker, but still existed. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Bhalla_Roy_1988.pdf&quot;&gt;Bhalla and Roy&lt;/a&gt; (1988) went back to the Indian data as well, and incorporated information on soil quality directly, finding that the IFSP weakened substantially when you control for this. Implicitly, when they controlled for soil quality, they were comparing small farms to large farms that have the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; quality of soil. And when they did that, the IFSP disappeared in most settings. They concluded that the evidence for the IFSP was weak. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Benjamin_1995.pdf&quot;&gt;Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; (1995) used Indonesian data, and came at the question indirectly. Without getting into the weeds on this, he finds that unobservable characteristics (e.g. land quality) likely explain the IFSP in the raw data, but didn’t have direct data on land quality. So there is/was some evidence that the IFSP could be accounted for by land quality, but hang onto that result for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different line of research tried to assess the source of the IFSP by looking at &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt;-household variation in yields by plots. There are a few papers that did this, but let me use &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Assuncao_Braido_2007.pdf&quot;&gt;Assuncao and Braido&lt;/a&gt; (2007) as the example here. These authors used Indian data, and were able to look not only at each farmer, but at each &lt;em&gt;plot&lt;/em&gt; used by each farmer. What they found was that there was an IFSP that held across each individual farmers plots. That is, the same farmer achieves higher yields on smaller plots than on larger plots. This suggests that household-specific explanations are not to blame for the IFSP. That is, it cannot just be that some farms use family labor and some farms have to hire in workers, and that they face different implicit prices for labor (or for other inputs). These are the same farmers, and they can adjust the labor they do use however they want across plots. Assuncao and Braido suggested instead that perhaps their result reflects unmeasured differences in land quality across the plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a 2010 paper by &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Barrett_etal_2010.pdf&quot;&gt;Barrett, Bellemare, and Hou&lt;/a&gt; did a similar study, but with very detailed soil quality measurements done on each specific plot a farmer uses (the data is from Madagascar). What they find is that the land quality differences explain &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; of the differential yields across plot sizes, and that thus the IFSP is not due to land quality differences. What remains is possible &lt;em&gt;intra&lt;/em&gt;-household inefficiency in allocations of labor across plots, or perhaps the IFSP just reflects errors in how we measure the size of farms and/or plots. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Lamb_2003.pdf&quot;&gt;Lamb&lt;/a&gt; (2003) was one of the first to suggest the IFSP was due to some measurement error in the area of farms, but a recent paper by &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Carletto_etal_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;Carletto, Savastano, and Zezza&lt;/a&gt; (2013) using data from Uganda that uses GPS tracking claims that accurate measurement of plots actually &lt;em&gt;reinforces&lt;/em&gt; the IFSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means we might be down to just intra-household explanations. And at that point I’m not sure what to tell you, because then it becomes closer to saying that farmers are leaving dollar bills on the sidewalk (or that there is some additional unmeasured difference in land quality we just cannot capture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-u-shaped-relationship&quot;&gt;The U-shaped relationship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we leave the IFSP behind, we have to check in with another recent paper from &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/papers/Foster_Rosenzweig_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;Foster and Rosenzweig&lt;/a&gt; (2017) that tells us that the stylized facts behind the IFSP are in fact incorrect, and that what we should be looking at is the U-shaped relationship of yields and farm size. While among relatively small farms in developing countries we see the IFSP, this does not capture what is seen in more developed economies, where yields &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; as farm size increases. By itself, that might not be very interesting, as it may be a little like comparing apples and oranges. But what the authors show is that using more recent data from India there is a clear U-shaped relationship of farm size and yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fr_fig6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Foster and Rosenzweig Figure 6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure shows the raw data they use to make this claim, and the U-shape is obvious. Above 10 acres, yields rise with size. Now, you can subject this to similar types of analysis to what I explained in the prior section, such as controlling for soil quality and looking only at plots run by a single given farmer. In each case, they find that the U-shape persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fr_fig8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Foster and Rosenzweig Figure 8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second figure shows the yields after controlling for these things. The blue line shows the case when they looked across farmers plots, and controlled for soil quality. The squiggly nature of the estimated line comes from the fact that they are allowing for a flexible estimation, and so small variations in yields are going to show up in the line. Nevertheless, the U-shape still appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is really interesting is that this is essentially the same analysis that was done in Assuncao and Braido. But those authors used Indian data from 1975-1984, while Foster and Rosenzweig are using Indian data from 2009-2014. It is possible that the IFSP held as expected in the earlier period, and it is only with subsequent development (e.g. the availability of new types of capital goods) that the upward slope among large farms appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FR work out a theory that can help explain the U-shape, and it really is a nesting of two explanations. First, they assume that there are some labor market issues as the classic IFSP explanations use. First, labor gets more expensive as farms get larger (when farms are small). Second, capital goods require a minimum scale of farm or plot to use, but these capital goods are really productive. Hence you see yields fall from very small to medium-sized farms due to the effect of rising labor costs, and then somewhere around 10 hectares (in this data) it starts to make sense to use capital goods, which starts to raise yields as you get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that one of the implications of the IFSP could be that land redistribution would increase output. This is no longer so clear with the FR results. If you took all the land and redistributed it out in 10-hectare parcels, so that there was no inequality in land holdings, you’d get the &lt;em&gt;lowest&lt;/em&gt; possible yield from the land. Your best bet, given their data, is to redistribute such that you &lt;em&gt;maximized&lt;/em&gt; inequality, with a bunch of very small farms (high yields due to low labor costs) and very large farms (big enough to use capital).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FR results bring back in some notions of earlier ag and development economists suggesting that fostering agricultural consolidation, and encouraging large farms that could leverage modern capital and techniques, was the best way to raise agricultural output. That strategy faced the problem of explaining what exactly the now-landless small farmers were supposed to do, but from the IFSP facts that suggested it would not actually raise yields. Does the calculus change if you know yields would actually rise given a consolidation of land into large farms? Would it allow you enough resources to compensate the small holders who lost land - assuming that you could figure out a way to actually make that compensation happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its relevance for thinking about the aggregate level of production in agriculture, and the possible effects of land redistribution, the IFSP and/or U-shaped relationship remains a relevant topic for development economics. What I think remains the really key question is why the IFSP part of the relationship appears to hold &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; households, where the farmers should face fewer frictions to allocating resources. Quick gut reactions are that it might have to do with distance (e.g. large plots tend to be located far away?) or some kind of limited stock of management ability/attention that can be allocated by a farmer to different plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, Garett. Now I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Detecting changes in trend growth</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Gordon-Again/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Gordon-Again/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick aside before I start the main part of the post. My blogging has been sparse in the last few months, or even year. This was in large part a reaction to working on a book about the growth slowdown, and time that would have gone into posts got poured into that book. Topics that I would have addressed in posts here got folded into the text of that book. As a few days ago, I’ve got a contract to publish that with the U. of Chicago Press, and it should come out in 2019. There is still some revising to do, but at this point I should get back to some more regular blogging, as I’m out of the weeds on getting the book drafted. Famous last words, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to actual posting. One of the very early posts on this blog, back in 2014, asked “&lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/is-robert-gordon-right-about-u-s-growth/&quot;&gt;Is Robert Gordon right about U.S. growth?&lt;/a&gt;”. Gordon had written a few pieces explaining that, as of 2007, the trend growth rate of GDP per capita in the U.S. was 0.9%. That is just under half of the trend growth rate that held through most of the 20th century and up to 2007, roughly 2% per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did in that post was point out that it would take several years to accumulate enough evidence to reject the hypothesis (in a statistical sense) that the growth rate was still 2%. The issue is that there are fluctuations in GDP per capita around trend (e.g. recessions, booms), and thus it was possible that GDP per capita could still have a 2% trend growth rate, yet GDP per capita could grow quite slowly for a few years due to the effects of the financial crisis or other fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I came up with in that post was that it would be 2018 before we could make some concrete statements about whether the trend growth rate had fallen below 2%. I really should wait until next year when the data from 2018 are available, but nevertheless it seemed interesting to revisit this question now that we’ve got more evidence on GDP per capita from the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in evaluating whether trend growth has dropped below 2% it turns out to be important to distinguish between changes in the growth rate and changes in the level of GDP per capita. The distinction of the level and growth rate is similar to the distinction between the lane you are in on a highway, and your forward speed. Your forward speed could be identical in either lane in the long run, but if you change lanes (i.e. there is a level shift) your &lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt; speed (i.e. the growth rate) will drop for a few moments as you transfer some of that into moving sideways. And we don’t want to use the temporary drop in forward speed from changing lanes to make an inference about your long-run forward speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this setting, we could think of two versions of Gordon’s hypothesis. The first is that the growth rate changed in 2007, but there was no level shift. That is like saying that you stayed in the same lane, but the car slowed down. The second is that there was a level shift in 2007 - you changed lanes - &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that the car slowed down once you got into the new lane. It will be much easier to detect the change in speed in the first situation than in the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m calling this “Gordon’s hypothesis”, but the general idea that the trend growth rate has dropped is not a unique prediction of his, and is probably the default hypothesis for most people who pay attention to the economy. He just put a specific number on the drop, so it makes his prediction more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-drop-in-the-growth-rate&quot;&gt;A simple drop in the growth rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the first version of Gordon’s argument, that the growth rate dropped in 2007, but there was no level shift. Taking that as the alternative, I did some very crude calculations in the original post asking when it might be plausible to reject the hypothesis that trend growth was still 2%. The intuition of those calculations was that if trend growth was in fact 0.9% - if we had slowed down - then eventually GDP per capita would fall so far below the 2% trend that we’d have to reject that growth was still 2%. At some point in time it wouldn’t be plausible anymore that all we were seeing were some fluctuation that took us below trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_gordon_trend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure tries to give you some visual for this situation. The solid black line represents the old trend line, estimated using data from 1950 to 2007 (the actual growth rate of this is about 2.1%). The gray lines above and below that 2% trend line are the error bands, meaning that if GDP per capita were in that range, we couldn’t reject that 2% trend growth was accurate. What you also see is the dashed black line representing 0.9% growth starting in 2007, Gordon’s hypothesis. And again, there are gray error bands around this showing where we might expect GDP per capita to be if 0.9% growth was true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can see the thick black line tracking actual GDP per capita. The financial crisis in 2009 drops the economy below all the error bands, which just represents how dramatic the crisis was relative to the normal fluctuations we might expect in GDP per capita. Since 2009, GDP per capita continued to track upward, but not very rapidly. What seems to be clear from this figure is that GDP per capita is well outside of the 2% error bands, and has been for several years. From this we should reject 2% trend growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean Gordon is right? In favor of the 0.9% hypothesis is that GDP per capita falls within the error bands of that trend. Which means we &lt;em&gt;cannot reject&lt;/em&gt; 0.9% growth. But that is different than saying 0.9% is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. We also cannot reject 1% growth, or 0.7% growth. Nevertheless, whether we want to buy Gordon’s precise 0.9% alternative, it would appear that the old trend line no longer applies. We’re just too far out of range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;separating-trend-growth-and-trend-level&quot;&gt;Separating trend growth and trend level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we dispense with 2% trend growth, we need to think about the distinction of the growth rate and the level. It is quite possible that the financial crisis shifted the &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; of GDP per capita down, but that the growth rate of GDP per capita remained around 2% on trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_gordon_shift.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level shift&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see what I mean, take a look at this next figure. Here, what I’ve done is show what a simple level shift - a lane change - looks like for the economy that keeps the 2% trend growth rate. I eyeballed the level shift so that the financial crisis set the new level. But given that new lower level, the growth rate stays the same, and so the dashed lines show the trend and error bands we could expect for GDP per capita after the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is less obvious that we can reject a trend 2% growth rate. The actual path of GDP per capita is still within the error bands of 2% growth &lt;em&gt;given the new level&lt;/em&gt;. We are just about to scrape outside of those error bands, so within the next year or so, barring an economic miracle, you’d probably reject 2% growth even if you believed there was a level shift after the financial crisis. But we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, even if next year we decide that we can reject a trend 2% growth rate, that is different from accepting that growth is 0.9%. All we’ll know is that it &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; 2%. It might be 1.7%, or 1.5%, or something else. But even if we can’t say that Gordon’s prediction is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; precisely, we could certainly say that he is right that the trend growth rate is &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; than it was prior to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-run-implications&quot;&gt;Long run implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction I’m making here between the two situations may seem overblown. Regardless of the scenario, we definitely seem to be below the old trend line. True, but the implications of the two scenarios for the future are very different. If we really are going to experience 0.9 or 1% growth for the indefinite future, that is far &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than experiencing a level shift in GDP per capita followed by continued 2% growth (or something like 1.5% growth). Compounding always wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to 2007, and start there. Now extrapolate out different scenarios to 2040. On the old trend line, GDP per capita in 2040 would be almost exactly 2 times (98%) higher than in 2007. If starting in 2007 the trend growth rate dropped to 0.9%, then GDP per capita in 2040 would be only 35% higher than in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was a level shift after 2007 that lowered the trend line by 9% (what I drew in the figure), but the growth rate remained at 2%, then in 2040 GDP per capita would be 81% higher than in 2007. That’s much better than in the situation with the lower growth rate. And even if there is a level shift &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the growth rate drops to 1.5%, we’d still have GDP per capita in 2040 48% higher than in 2007. Still better off than if the growth rate dropped to 0.9% per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that you don’t want to confuse the scenarios with growth changes and level shifts. These have very distinct implications for the future. And the available evidence on GDP per capita doesn’t tell us which of these scenarios is right, and which is wrong. All we know is that we can reject the old 2% trend line, but we’ll need more evidence before we can figure out whether we saw a drop to a lower growth rate only, or a level shift and possible drop int he growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What determines value?</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Value-Everything/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Value-Everything/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2z9NWXJ&quot;&gt;The Value of Everything&lt;/a&gt;, by Mariana Mazzucato, a few weeks ago, and have finally gotten around to writing up something of a review. This book made me think, so I count that as a positive recommendation. Sometimes I was thinking things like, “This is ridiculous, you cannot refuse to acknowledge the difference in stocks and flows!”, but in between those there were some genuine moments where Mazzucato got me to see things from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mazzucato makes the point - obvious in retrospect but easy to forget - that the value of economic activity involves a choice. A choice of what “counts” as having value, and what does not. In exploring this, she works through the systems that past writers have used, and compares that to ideas that underlay our current thinking. This is not just a question of “what gets counted in GDP?”, but intended to be broader. Her question is something like, “by using GDP what implicit decisions have we made about what has economic value?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threads of her answer come a little undone by later in the book. After setting up the contingent nature of measuring economic value, she moves into questioning why finance is assigned too much value, while government is assigned too little. I think she intends all this to be radical, but I think the book fails to provide the real kill shot on this. A radical book would outline a new means of assigning value, even in vague terms, but I didn’t get that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as I said the book did get me thinking on several points. What follows then is far less in the way of review, and more speculative response. Caveat emptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-counts-as-valuable&quot;&gt;What counts as valuable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What became apparent to me in reading Mazzucato’s history was that in most cases, the notion of what counted as valuable in the economy had less to do with &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt;, and more to do with the &lt;em&gt;inputs&lt;/em&gt;. The Physiocrats, for example, explained that economic value came from agriculture alone. If something was produced using the land, and some sturdy peasants and perhaps some draft animals, then that something had economic value. Any other transactions that took place, like people moving or trading grain, didn’t add value. They shuffled value around between the movers or traders, but didn’t create value. You could increase value only by adding land, peasants, or animals. I’d guess that if you pressed the Physiocrat line, you could allow for technological change in agriculture to raise value, but regardless, value was assigned only to output coming from a specific set of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a big leap from here to Marx, where value was located in the labor effort that went into a product. Marx dropped the focus on land or agriculture, per se, but retained the concept that what determined whether output had value was whether it used labor. You could have a hypothetical factory that ran on complete automation, and used no labor. That output could only have value from digging back into the labor used in producing the factory, etc.., but the point is similar to the Physiocrats. It took the “right” inputs to create value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to snort at the ideas of the Physiocrats and Marx regarding this kind of thinking. But I’d argue that the most peoples intuitive sense of “economic value” still comes back to their sense of which inputs were used. Much like Marx, most people will attribute value to output based on the perceived labor effort that went into producing it. Like the Physiocrats, production that involves extracting or processing raw materials is considered to have value. Again, it takes the “right” inputs to create value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see examples of this all over the place. To demonstrate the Physiocrat/Marxist attitude, I give you Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose Senate testimony on Trump’s tariffs is quated in this article from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/06/20/wilbur-ross-canada-steel_a_23463975/&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a trade deficit of note (on steel),” Ross replied. “We have a surplus in dollars; we do not have a surplus in physical value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could do a whole class unpacking the incoherence of that statement. But let’s focus on the fact that what ultimately matters to Ross is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the notion of dollars, but rather the “physical value”. Steel is built from “real” inputs, so it has a real value beyond anything that we can measure with dollars. I think you can get some traction in thinking about the motives behind tariffs (and support for them) if you consider this notion of value. We can be “losing” at trade because we import things of value (based on their input content) from abroad, even if the associated money flows don’t look so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a different context, when people argue for a minimum wage, or a “living wage”, they often appeal to the idea that a hard days work (e.g. the input) grants the work value different from and beyond the dollar value that work earns on the open market. Support for family farms has a similar language of value based on fact that it employs physical labor and - Physiocratic-style - land. It is seen as unfair if this labor and land does not generate a large monetary value, because we assign inherent value to those inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see something of this in the original sets of national accounts, where far more attention was paid to counting up manufacturing output (based on real inputs like labor and coal and iron) that to service output (which presumably used less inherently valuable labor, and, &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;, no iron ore at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense that finance doesn’t “count” works in a similar way. The inputs that go into finance work - people sitting at desks being clever - aren’t assigned value by themselves. The notion of “bullshit” jobs is another example of judging value based on the nature of the input - presumably sitting at a desk and stapling. No one considers farming or mining or manufacturing a “bullshit” job, why? Because they involve “real” labor input, physical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mazzucato engages in this type of argument, although she doesn’t phrase it this way. Her argument that a number of financial activities do not have value is because they involves &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; inputs. Well, a little bit of clever accounting, perhaps, but for all intents and purposes the only “input” they are using is market power. Because the output produced by finance doesn’t rely on real inputs, it cannot have real value. The opposite holds for government and public sector work. This involves real labor (e.g. police officers) and other real inputs (e.g. highways) so it has real value, even if we have trouble putting a clear number on it because of a lack of a profit and loss statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say that there is nothing inherently wrong with Mazzucatos position, as in there being some kind of logical inconsistency. She, and everyone, is welcome to value inputs and hence the output of different sectors in any way they want. The question becomes why standard measures of economic activity, like GDP, have diverged so much from Mazzucatos notion of value, and whether there is some way to bring them back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gdp-and-the-value-of-output&quot;&gt;GDP and the value of output&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get to the point where finance is valued “too much”, while government is valued “too little”? Let’s go back and think about how we would add up the value of economic activity if we did appeal to our notions of which inputs matter, or are “real” enough to count. How do you compare the value of one product to another? How do you compare the labor used in one product to another? Just time? Or does skill matter? How do you add up the value of a bushel of corn with a ton of steel? Do those values change over time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to value economic output based on your opinion of the inputs involved, and that’s fine. But I’m not sure you can do that, for all the reasons that Hayek laid out long ago. It’s an information problem. There are too many products, with too much heterogeneity, and too many inputs, for you to come up with a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; set of rules to value output. And no, general principles don’t solve this, because you need to make particular decisions. The general principles of national income accounting are simple, but the details of how and what we count run to hundreds of pages. And what if I disagree with your opinion, how do we reconcile this? I guess we could each have our own individual measure of economic activity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you want a single measure then you need a consistent way of measuring the value of output from different activities relative to one another, so that you can add them up. The only practical way to do this we’ve come up with so far is to use relative prices. This is how GDP is calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for Mazzucato is that by using relative prices, it breaks the link to the inherent value of inputs. Products that have high prices count for a lot, even if those high prices are due to markups from market power, rather than some “true” value of the inputs used. Hence finance, where the markups seem to represent market power to Mazzucato (e.g. net interest margin) gets a heavy weight. Government, where we don’t even have a clear measure of the true price of the output because it isn’t bought and sold like a normal good, ends up downweighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that Mazzucatos argument about the problems with using relative prices is very compelling, for the reasons I laid out above about information. There does not seem to be a plausible way to add up economic activity without using prices. I guess to my point much earlier, if this was a radical book it would have proposed some kind of structure to add up activity that does not involve these prices. But I didn’t see that radical idea. In a lot of ways, Mazzucato’s point is just that relative prices are a poor approximation of &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; utilities, even if they are good approximations of &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; utilities. Note, by the way, that even if there is market power and markups that relative prices are still a good indicator of marginal utilities. See my post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox-2/&quot;&gt;paradox of markups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while I’d leave aside this particular criticism of using relative prices, I still think there was a lot of value (yes, that was deliberate) in the book for thinking about how inputs inform our opinions on inherent value. There is a coherent argument to make about how we could or should value certain economic activities more, in the sense of supporting or encouraging them, even if they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lead to higher measured GDP, but because they involve the use of some inherently valuable inputs. For example, you could argue that a jobs guarantee is valuable even if it led to GDP being lower than it would otherwise (of course, it might be higher, but that’s a different argument). That would be the case of valuing things based on the nature of the input (e.g. full time work for adults) rather than on the value of output. But using relative prices to value GDP is neither an argument for, nor against, your position.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sustained growth and the increase in work hours</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Leisure/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Leisure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in March, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/When-Growth/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a summary of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobweisdorf.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/unreal-wages_humphries-and-weisdorf_dec-2017_wp1.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; by Jane Humphries and Jacob Weisdorf on the onset of economic growth. Their paper documented &lt;em&gt;annual&lt;/em&gt; labor contract terms in England over several centuries, and compared those to the typical &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; labor rates that have been used in economic history to study the onset of growth and the effects of the Industrial Revolution. The short version of that paper is that the annual labor contracts starting seeing sustained growth in their value around 1650 or so, far sooner than the day wages indicated. This pushes back the origin of economic growth to well before the actual technological IR, and this also matches the data on GDP per capita developed by Broadberry, Campbell, Klein, Overton, and van Leeuwen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GnD1Nm&quot;&gt;British Economic Growth, 1270-1870&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I didn’t address in my post, but which came up in a few replies I saw, was whether the data on annual contracts (and on GDP per capita) indicate a rise in &lt;em&gt;living standards&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s take the day wage data as factually correct, and those day wages remained roughly constant from 1650-ish to 1850-ish. This has several implications. First, people that did work for day wages in this period would only see their annual income rise by working more days or hours per day. Second, if the value of annual contracts were tied in some way to the day wage, then annual contracts rose in value also due to rising work effort in days/hours. For both types of workers this doesn’t seem to indicate that they are better off, just working more hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what little evidence we do have on actual hours worked does seem to indicate that they increased a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; in the period around the actual Industrial Revolution. Hans-Joachim Voth, in two papers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jechis/v58y1998i01p29-58_01.html&quot;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jechis/v61y2001i04p1065-1082_04.html&quot;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2JxpQLl&quot;&gt;Time and Work During the Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, provided estimates of work hours based on court records. Around 1760, annual hours were about 2500, while in 1800 and 1830 annual hours were about 3300, before dropping back to about 2700 in 1870. In the period of the actual (technological) Industrial Revolution, it would appear that work hours did rise substantially. We know the day wages did not rise until around 1850-ish. But with the rise in hours worked, the annual income of a worker would have risen during the early 1800’s. We might assume that those workers on annual contracts, if they were part of the same labor market, would also have seen their hours rise, and hence their annual income growth was due to more work time as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t settle anything, however. The HW data indicate that the value of annual contracts began to grow in the middle of the 1600’s, well before the rise in hours documented by Voth. If annual hours were consistent at 2500 from 1650 to 1750, then that means the rise in annual contracts represented growth in the implicit income per hour for those workers as well. On the other hand, you could argue that even the growth that HW document was driven by hours. In the 100 years from 1650 to 1750, HW estimate annual contracts grew in value by 67%-ish. If that was driven entirely by an increase in hours worked, then hours worked had to grow by about 67% as well. That would mean that in 1650 annual hours worked on these contracts were around 1,500. Is that reasonable? I don’t know that there is an obvious answer to that question. There is plenty of evidence for long idle periods in agricultural work, and so 1,500 hours in a year might have been the normal amount expected in 1650. On the other hand, that seems like a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; increase in hours worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s assume that even the rise in annual contract value was driven entirely by an increase in hours worked. And let’s stretch this argument out so that while annual contracts (as well as GDP per capita) started growing in 1650, it wasn’t until 1850 that this was because day/hour rates rose. Does this mean that the growth in annual contracts and GDP per capita did not represent a rise in &lt;em&gt;living standards&lt;/em&gt; until 1850?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to that depends on the reason for the rise in work hours. If they were physically coerced, then for sure you’d say that the growth in per worker annual contracts or GDP didn’t represent a rise in living standards. But on the assumption that the extra hours were not coerced, then we need to think hard about the labor supply decision of workers. Mark Koyama has a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://mason.gmu.edu/~mkoyama2/About_files/Koyama12a.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that lays out a simple theoretical model for thinking about this, and the particular feature of this model that matters is the possibility of a backward-bending labor supply curve. When wages are very low, people provide very little labor to the market. Why bother? But as wages rise, people provide more labor to the market, because it is worth their time to work, as the wage they earn allows them to consume more goods. But on the assumption that people do enjoy non-work time, at some point the wage gets high enough that people start providing &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; labor. If you can earn enough to buy everything you want in 30 hours a week, why work 40 hours? This is the backward bending part of the labor supply curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Mark does is then work through various ways in which work hours might rise, the implication for living standards, and how these relate to different stories about economic growth. We can see which might make sense in the English case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immiserating-growth-or-involution&quot;&gt;Immiserating growth or involution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case is one where the wage starts (say in 1650) high enough that we are “on” the backward bending part of the labor supply curve. At this point, a negative productivity shock (e.g. a bad harvest) pushes down the wage, and because we are on the backward bending part of the supply curve, this &lt;em&gt;raises&lt;/em&gt; the amount of labor done. More hours at a lower wage would imply workers are worse off. Yet, if the elasticity of labor supply with respect to wage is &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; enough, then the overall effect on earnings is &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt;. A large shift in L, even with a decline in w, can mean that wL (total earnings) increase. We could thus interpret the onset of annual contract growth in the HW data as an example of immiserating growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue with this story is that while we do not see growth in daily wages in the data, we also do not see a substantial &lt;em&gt;decline&lt;/em&gt; in wages. Yes, wages appear to decline from about 1450 to 1650, after the Black Death when population is rising, but after 1650 the wage data shows, if anything, a very small positive trend. Without clear evidence of a drop in the wage, and with the need for what seems like an unreasonably large labor supply elasticity, this story doesn’t seem to fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;involution&quot;&gt;Involution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a second theoretical case that can be used to generate more hours without rising living standards. This could occur because of an increase in the price of a necessity or subsistence good, like food. Because people have to consume a certain amount of this necessity, if it gets more expensive, they have to either work more hours, or decrease their consumption of all other goods. Under the assumption that people enjoy both leisure and consuming other things, they’ll decrease both by a little. The drop in leisure means an increase in work time, and hence we’ve got a rise in hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t require us to assume that workers are already on backward-bending part of the labor supply curve. The rise of the price of the necessity shifts down the whole labor supply curve down, and so people work more hours regardless of where they were to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this results in an increase in measured earnings (wL) depends on the effect of the rise in the price of the necessity on the equilibrium wage, and how much the labor supply curve shifts. You can wrestle the model into giving you an increase in wL, while people are still worse off. This kind of effect has been called “involution” before, a concept that at some point in my life I’ll write a much longer post about. But for the present post, the problem is that there is no obvious rise in food prices in England starting in 1650.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;industrious-revolution&quot;&gt;Industrious revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the last case that delivers an increase in work hours and living standards, which captures the intuition of Jan de Vries “Industrious Revolution”, which you can read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2l1dSuL&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in one of the more enjoyable books on economic history you’ll come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story here is that there are different kinds of consumption. Some consumption is time-intense (e.g. Netflix) in that it requires a little of your money, but a lot of your time to consume it. Some consumption is good-intense (e.g. clothes) which requires a lot of your money, but very little of your time. And no, don’t get too picky on that distinction. Yes, you might wear a shirt for 12 hours, but once it is on you don’t have to spend any time or attention to keep wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time-intense consumption is cheap, then you’ll tend to buy lots of it, and that means you’ll work very little. You don’t need much money to buy these consumption items (so you don’t need to work much), and you do need time to enjoy them. The argument here would be that England prior to 1650 was a world in which time-intense consumption was cheap. Workers had little need to work more hours, because why bother? What were you going to purchase with that extra income? It made sense to buy the time-intense consumption good, leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But around the middle of the 17th century, in line with de Vries’ argument, new good-intense consumption goods became available, like sugar and tea. So people shifted their consumption towards these things, which did not require much time to enjoy, but did require you to purchase something. So putting more labor into the market made sense. Similarly, the price of textiles was falling at this time (yes, prior to the IR). People shifted from the time-intense activity  of making ones own clothes, towards the good-intense purchase of ready-made clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in the price of these good-intense consumption items “straightens out” the labor supply curve, making the transition to backward-bending occur at a higher level. And hence for any given wage, the labor supplied is higher. In this setting, living standards are &lt;em&gt;rising&lt;/em&gt; with the increase in work time, as this is an optimal response to a drop in the price of one of the available consumption items. The drop in the price of good-intense items shifted time spent at home (and out of the labor market) into time spent in the labor market. Unlike the prior two explanations, the data work here. The prices of things like tea and sugar and clothing did fall in the period starting from the mid-1600’s, at the same time hours were rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-is-it-all-about-trade&quot;&gt;So is it all about trade?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s say that we buy the story of the industrious revolution, and buy that the onset of growth in annual labor contracts and GDP per capita starting in 1650 represented a real gain in living standards. One interesting implication of this is that the origin of sustained growth was associated, in large part, with the expansion of trade in England. Rather than a series of clear technological breakthroughs (e.g. the spinning jenny, etc.) it was the “technology” of trade, by inducing a change in the available basket of consumption goods, that kick-started sustained growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a fascinating question is how important trade was in &lt;em&gt;sustaining&lt;/em&gt; sustained growth. That is, the availability of cheap trade goods could have created a period of rapid growth in the late 17th century, perhaps running through the late 18th century. But without the continued expansion of trade to bring in new goods, or finding cheaper sources of those goods, could growth have continued? Even if you could find new and cheaper imports, at some point wouldn’t people reach a limit on how much additional time they wanted to work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence you could argue that the technological Industrial Revolution of the late 1700’s and early 1800’s was necessary to keep sustained growth going after trade got things started, and that technological innovation is still necessary for growth to continue indefinitely. But you could also argue that without trade creating growth to begin with, there never would have been an incentive to make those technological changes in the first place. I’m well beyond my brainpower capacity to answer this. But the HW data, along with the Broadberry et al data on GDP per capita, by pushing back the date of sustained growth to 1650, makes the link between trade and the Industrial Revolution more salient. Did the Industrious Revolution trigger the Industrial Revolution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the answer to that, I think it is a good working hypothesis that the growth documented by HW and Broadberry et al starting in the 1650’s was associated with real gains in living standards, as the increase in hours worked is consistent with a switch to goods-intense consumption items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-complete-aside&quot;&gt;A complete aside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has absolutely nothing to do with the onset of sustained growth. But the logic of the industrious revolution I presented above can be used in reverse to think about changes in economic growth in the recent past. You could argue that recent innovations have made time-intense consumption items (e.g. Netflix or video games) cheaper. And in a mirror image response to the 1600’s, people are substituting more time-intense consumption for goods-intense consumption. This means that they willingly withdraw labor from the market in order to enjoy those time-intense activities, as in the proverbial 20-something male living in his parents basement playing Halo all day. Nothing terribly insightful here, I just thought I was interesting to think about this as the flip of the industrious revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The paradox of markups, part 2</title>
        <link>https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox-2/</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox-2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I told you I wouldn’t leave you waiting on the next post concerning markups and the paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/JCsTqiauR0JBboj3vsNFRhyw9MrxV3B0j7L3f4fURJnfAUAxSXJXASiRl8OFiU2F/file&quot;&gt;David Baqaee and Emmanuel Fahri&lt;/a&gt;, so here you go. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I described the (at times) paradoxical nature of markups. When there is &lt;em&gt;dispersion&lt;/em&gt; in markups, output is lower than it could otherwise be, given technology. But when there is dispersion in markups, there are circumstances - like increasing markups in low-markup producers or shifting resources towards high-markup producers - where raising the average markup in the economy will be associated with higher output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is in the BF paper, but it is not the main purpose of it. One of the main contributions of the paper is to show that you can generalize these effects of markups to almost any arbitrary model of the economy. The paradox is not just the result of making some particular assumptions about production functions or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One application they pursue (among many) is decomposing productivity growth into terms involving technology and terms involving allocative efficiency. If you read this blog at all, you know that productivity is a big bucket of different things going on in the economy. In that bucket are true technology effects, the ability to physically produce more widgets given some set of physical inputs. But also in that bucket are things like the allocation of those inputs across firms that produce different kinds of widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decomposing-productivity-growth&quot;&gt;Decomposing productivity growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the economy were perfectly efficient, meaning that the inputs we use were allocated across different firms such that we were at the maximum possible output level, then productivity would measure &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; true technological improvements. Yes, inputs might move between different firms in response to technological changes, but the &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of the economy is being held constant, and so those changes in input use have zero effect on productivity to a first approximation. The problem with using productivity to measure technology is not that inputs move around, per se, it is that the movement of inputs may not represent a move from one efficient equilibrium to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example to illustrate what I mean. Let’s say that in 2004, all the inputs (e.g. labor) in the economy were allocated in an efficient manner, and output was as high as it could possibly be given the specific physical technologies available in that year. We look at this allocation and say, clearly this is the best way to allocate inputs, so let’s pass a law to freeze the allocations at the 2004 shares. If 4% of all people worked at the Gap in 2004, then 4% of all people would always be required to work at the Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, though, there are changes in the specific physical technologies used by different firms. Some may have better technology, some worse. Perhaps the Gap discovers a better way to fold shirts. Who knows. Because the technologies changed, there &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be changes in the allocation of inputs. In an efficient economy, there &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be changes in the allocations. But we have this dumb law that says the allocations cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a productivity perspective, the growth in productivity - which remember is the output we can produce given a set of inputs - is affected by two things. First, there are the specific technological changes that occurred. By themselves, those should &lt;em&gt;raise&lt;/em&gt; productivity (remember the cool new folding technique at the Gap). Second, there are now all the distortions introduced by the law. More than 4% of the labor force should work at the Gap now, but it is confined to only employing 4%. Thus we are getting less output than we could, and hence productivity is &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity growth is thus a combination of the positive technological effect, and a negative effect of the allocation law. What we’d like to do is separate out those two effects. And that is what BF propose to do, in a setting that allows for any kind of arbitrary structure in terms of production functions, links between firms acting as suppliers to one another, and preferences. The contribution of their work is not to identify this issue in measuring productivity - we’ve known about that for a while - but to develop a way to manage that issue in almost any conceivable setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do they do? Intuitively, they say you have to calculate the &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt; outcome in 2005 given the changes in technology. Then you compare the productivity of this hypothetical efficient 2005 economy with the efficient 2004 economy, and in that case the productivity you measure is getting the “pure” effect of technology, &lt;em&gt;holding constant the efficiency of the economy&lt;/em&gt;. In theory that is possible to do, but in practice it is hard (impossible) because you don’t know how much the true physical productivity of each firm improved over time. Hold on to that problem for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve calculated this pure technological effect, you are left with changes in productivity that are due to changes in allocative efficiency. Here, the idea is that you are comparing the &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of the economy in 2004 to the &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of the economy in 2005, without asking about the technological changes. What BF show is that given some readily available data on markups and factor income shares (e.g. wages as a fraction of output) you can calculate this allocative efficiency effect without too much trouble, and this is true no matter how complex the underlying economy may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall productivity growth is thus a combination of the pure technology effect and the allocative efficiency effect. The simple math is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\% \Delta Prod = \% \Delta Tech + \% \Delta AE.&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BF have data on productivity growth (this is just the normal thing we calculate from data on output and inputs), and they show how to calculate &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\% \Delta AE\inline&quot;/&gt;. So in the end they don’t need to measure the precise technological changes of each firm, they can just back out the &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\% \Delta Tech\inline&quot;/&gt; term from the above equation. You can infer the pure technological change in the economy once you measure the allocative efficiency change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement this, BF need some way of measuring allocative efficiency, and they use the data on markups charged by firms. They draw this data from a paper from Gutierrez and Philippon that I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Investment/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you recall from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, markups push the economy away from the efficient allocation, and so BF can use changes in markups to measure the change in how far away from that efficient allocation the economy moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_BF_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sources of productivity growth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of all this are in the figure. The blue line, labelled the Solow residual, shows how productivity itself grows over time. This is what they are trying to decompose. The allocative efficiency line (orange dashes) is the contribution to productivity from changes in how close to the efficient allocation the economy got. Notice that this term is &lt;em&gt;rising&lt;/em&gt; over time, meaning that according to their calculations the economy was more efficient in 2015 than in 1996. We’ll get back to that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, the difference between the blue line (productivity) and the orange dashed line (allocative efficiency) has to be the effect of pure technology. The purple line captures this, and you can see that this is also growing over time. But note that overall productivity grew faster than technology because of the allocative efficiency improvement. BF suggest that the each account for about 50% of the growth in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can also see one last source of growth in productivity, factor undercounting. I ignored this in my little analysis up above. This is capturing the fact that in the presence of markups the measure of inputs that we can calculate is not quite equal to the true level of input use. This effect can get very large - BF find it matters more using other data on markups that are larger than the Gutierrez and Philippon markups - but for the time being, lets set that effect aside.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wait-efficiency-was-going-up&quot;&gt;Wait, efficiency was going up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that BF find allocative efficiency was &lt;em&gt;improving&lt;/em&gt; over time is perhaps surprising. To see why this was occurring, we can turn to a further decomposition that BF provide. To understand this, it helps to think of the allocative efficiency term as being determined by something like a weighted average of the markups across firms. As a weighted average, it can change over time for two reasons. The markups themselves could change, or the weights could change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next figure, BF have separated out these two effects. The blue line is the same total allocative efficiency term from the first figure. The “markup effect” in orange dashes is measuring changes just the change in markups charged by firms, effectively holding the weights constant. The general increase in the “markup effect” comes from the fact that most markups were &lt;em&gt;falling&lt;/em&gt; according to the Gutierrez and Philippon data. If you want to refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, this is telling us that all the markups in the economy were collapsing towards one (meaning no markup), and that the economy was getting closer to the point where the ratio of marginal utilites was equal to the ratio of marginal costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig_BF_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sources of allocative efficiency&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have what BF call the “cross-entropy” effect. That is not terribly informative. It refers to the fact that the &lt;em&gt;weights&lt;/em&gt; in the weighted average of markups change over time. Recall that holding markups constant, if you push more resources into high-markup firms, this &lt;em&gt;raises&lt;/em&gt; productivity because the output of those firms is very valuable. The yellow line shows that productivity was rising over time due to this effect, and that in turn implies that more and more resources were getting pushed into high markup firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift towards higher markup firms is consistent with the rise in profit share at the aggregate level. But that shift didn’t mean that productivity was falling. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; situations in which the rising profit share would be associated with lower productivity; if firm-specific markups were rising this would detract from productivity while raising profits. But what appears to have happened here is that profits rose due to changes in the composition of spending towards high-markup firms, and that is associated with higher productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisiting-harbergers-triangle&quot;&gt;Revisiting Harberger’s triangle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The productivity accounting that BF do relates to changes in allocative efficiency, but only in a local sense. It tells us whether we are getting closer or farther from the efficient equilibrium, but it doesn’t tell us how far away the efficient equilibrium is to begin with. How much higher would output be if there were no markups?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BF use their setting to answer this question. The exact numbers depend on the precise set of markups they use, and some assumptions about the structure of the economy, but the answer is that output would be about 40% higher without markups. This is much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, higher than the traditional answer, usually attributed to Harberger, who said the losses from monopoly were around 0.1%. Harberger’s number was always a bad estimate, as it was based on looking across sectors (not firms) only within manufacturing. It was an other example of assuming that what occurs within manufacturing is the only thing that matters. But even so, the scale of the effect that BF find is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question is whether this substantial departure from the efficient equilibrium is worth it. We believe that markups are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to induce economic growth, as they provide the reward to those who innovate. Is operating 40% below the efficient outcome worth it, in the sense that the markups pushing us down there are in turn generating rapid growth? I have no idea what the answer to that question is. You’d need to build some more structure on top of the BF model to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another interesting thing about their calculations, and it is an aspect of the paradox of markups. The 40% number BF calculate is for 2014. For 1997, they find that the loss associated with markups is only 4.5%. The loss associated with markups rose from 1997 to 2014, and yet allocative efficiency improved from 1997 to 2014, which is what the productivity calculations showed. How can those two things both be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BF’s productivity calculations show that the economy was moving &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; the efficient equilibrium over time, and hence this contributed to productivity growth. But at the same time, the efficient equilibrium was moving farther and farther away. Think of me running a 100 meter race against Usain Bolt. He’s much faster, but I am running in the same direction, at least. My allocative efficiency improves, in the sense that I’m headed in the right direction. But my absolute efficiency declines, in the sense that Bolt gets farther and farther ahead of me every moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, without some more information, you can’t say whether falling further behind the efficient equilibrium is good or bad, but it is an interesting piece of information to throw into the mental wood chipper. It may be worth it to be further behind if that is associated with greater incentives to innovate. Or perhaps it is a correlate of the lack of dynamism in business formation and employment turnover that has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not even begun to scratch the surface of the interesting applications of the BF paper. I focused on the productivity accounting just because it is something I find to be of particular interest. The power of the paper is, to repeat, that these findings hold without having to make any strong assumptions about what production functions look like or how firms fit together into an input/output matrix. The only annoying thing about the paper is that it is forcing me to see how limited my understanding of the role of markups was in the economy. But it is well worth the effort to read it (so much notation!) if you’re into this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
