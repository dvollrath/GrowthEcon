<p>
The textbook is a concise introduction to modern growth theory, aimed at advanced undergraduates. I came aboard for this 3rd edition, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/">Chad Jones</a> (Stanford) is the original author. It covers the basic Solow model, endogenous innovations of both product-variety and quality-ladder types, and then takes on topics in development, the environment, and the take-off to sustained growth. It uses calculus and differential equations, but you can definitely adapt to teach it to students without that background (I do it every year). Below the image, there is a list of supplements you can adapt for your own course.

<li> These are a set of <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6823742/maps.zip">maps</a> in raw form (png, jpg, etc) that I like to use in class. It includes the picture of night lights you see on this site.</li>
