            <h2>About the Book</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The textbook is a concise introduction to modern growth theory, aimed at advanced undergraduates. I came aboard for this 3rd edition, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/">Chad Jones</a> (Stanford) is the original author. It covers the basic Solow model, endogenous innovations of both product-variety and quality-ladder types, and then takes on topics in development, the environment, and the take-off to sustained growth. It uses calculus and differential equations, but you can definitely adapt to teach it to students without that background (I do it every year).</p> 

          <p>You can click on the image to the right to find the Amazon page where you can purchase the book</p>

          <p>I like to think of the <a href="/blog">blog</a> as a supplement to the course, and I use a lot of posts as material when I teach from the book. The publisher's <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=4294969960">site</a> is here, if you want an exam copy or access to the solutions manual. It also includes PDF's of the books figures.</p>

          <p>This links to some basic <a href="/assets/SlidesAll.zip">slides</a> I use. The file includes both PDF's and Tex versions. And these are a set of <a href="/assets/maps.zip">maps</a> in raw form (png, jpg, etc) that I like to use in class. It includes the picture of night lights you see on this site.
